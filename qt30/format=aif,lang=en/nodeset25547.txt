Fiona Bruce[00:29:39] Well, I think <span class="highlighted" id="node1508_165634994953893920">they are putting their resources together for the benefits of this particular app</span>, as I understand it. Charles?<div><br></div><div>Charles[00:29:48] <span class="highlighted" id="node1513_165634994953893920">Yes</span>. It just seems that <span class="highlighted" id="node1674_165634994953893920">this is just another moment of government bluster actually hitting reality</span>. So, <span class="highlighted" id="node1529_165634994953893920">Matt Hancock and Baroness Harding said today that they’ve backed both horses of the Google and the android model and the NHS app</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node1536_165634994953893920">they’ve always insisted until this point that they were only going to pursue the NHS app</span>. So it just seems that <span class="highlighted" id="node1683_165634994953893920">the government are trying to make it seem that they’re trying to do the best job possible</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node1555_165634994953893920">when it comes to reality they might cover up and not pretend that they’ve done anything wrong</span>.</div><div><br></div><div>Fiona Bruce[00:30:19] Jed?</div><div><br></div><div>Jed Mercurio[00:30:20] Well, I think that <span class="highlighted" id="node1566_165634994953893920">the app can only really be an adjunct</span>. I think that <span class="highlighted" id="node1573_165634994953893920">there are technological limitations in the app in terms of providing a nation-wide service</span>. And really, <span class="highlighted" id="node1584_165634994953893920">it’s about having a functioning public health infrastructure that is able to deal with local outbreaks locally</span>. And unfortunately, <span class="highlighted" id="node1591_165634994953893920">the government has chosen to centralise and use a private company, Cerco, to take the lead on this</span>. And I think that <span class="highlighted" id="node1602_165634994953893920">a lot of public health officials and workers, as Lisa said, are frustrated that they’re not receiving the information</span>.</div>
