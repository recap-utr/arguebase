[FIONA BRUCE] : Do you think <span class="highlighted" id="node33757825_165528306817017572">we should lift restrictions on 21 June</span>?<div><br></div><div>Anthony Costello[0:16:04] <span class="highlighted" id="node33757859_165528306817017572">No, I don't</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node33757840_165528306817017572">We have the Indian variant which is now thought to be 50 to 70 percent more transmissible</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node33757847_165528306817017572">Evidence comes out today that you are 2.7 times more likely to end up in hospital with this variant compared to the Kent or Alpha variant</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node33757854_165528306817017572">it has evidence of vaccine escape</span>. If <span class="highlighted" id="node33757882_165528306817017572">you have had one dose of the vaccine you are only 34 percent protected</span>. If <span class="highlighted" id="node33757889_165528306817017572">you had two doses, you're only about two-thirds protected</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node33757894_165528306817017572">that means the real figure is only 40 percent of our population has had two doses</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node33757908_165528306817017572">That means there are millions and millions of people who could be infected by this virus</span>. Now, <span class="highlighted" id="node33757924_165528306817017572">many of them will be younger</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node33757931_165528306817017572">death rates should be much, much lower</span> but <span class="highlighted" id="node33757942_165528306817017572">many people could end up in hospital</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node33757954_165528306817017572">The NHS could be thrown into another surge</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node33757965_165528306817017572">We just don't know</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node33757972_165528306817017572">what do we do</span>? I think at the moment <span class="highlighted" id="node33758012_165528306817017572">what we have to do is watch the data extremely carefully in the next two to three weeks</span>. I think <span class="highlighted" id="node33757990_165528306817017572">we must devolve power and resources to local public health teams</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node33758001_165528306817017572">We haven't given the money and the contact traces that we need</span>.</div>
