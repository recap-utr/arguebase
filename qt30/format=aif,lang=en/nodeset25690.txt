If you <span class="highlighted" id="node7_163732244665966686">look at how much the government has spent paying people to be on furlough, that's about 100 billion a year</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node14_163732244665966686">That has put the economy on ice but it hasn't achieved anything very positive beyond making sure that people could keep going</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node23_163732244665966686">If we put that money, that kind of money into the transition to a green economy, it would create many, many jobs</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node34_163732244665966686">It would begin to pay for itself as those jobs raise the taxes that go back to the Treasury</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node47_163732244665966686">We can do this</span>. I think what is so frustrating,<span class="highlighted" id="node54_163732244665966686"> look at some of the countries in Europe who are already working out mass transit</span>, public transport schemes, <span class="highlighted" id="node61_163732244665966686">we should have a vision that isn't looking at petrol cars and thinking how do we replace all of those with electric cars</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node68_163732244665966686">the building of cars is energy-intensive</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node79_163732244665966686">We need more manualisation among public transport schemes</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node86_163732244665966686">The person at the back was saying she would love to use the train but it is more expensive than flying</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node93_163732244665966686">That is a policy choice the government made</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node100_163732244665966686">It could make a different choice</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node111_163732244665966686">It could tax the fuel domestically and make transport more affordable</span>. We know how to do this stuff. <span class="highlighted" id="node122_163732244665966686">What we need to do is a prime minister who isn't giving the green light to a coal mine</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node129_163732244665966686"> isn't planning Â£27 billion on the biggest road ever</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node140_163732244665966686">is serious about investing in the economy</span>.
