Fiona Bruce[00:04:17] Steve?<div>Steve Parish[00:04:18] Well, firstly, <span class="highlighted" id="node119_165634868933432116">I would agree with Jed</span>. I mean, I think that<span class="highlighted" id="node124_165634868933432116"> Marcus Rashford is an example, <span class="highlighted" id="node131_165634868933432116">as have lots of footballers been through this crisis</span>, of people that know the right thing to do</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node142_165634868933432116">do the right thing to do</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node153_165634868933432116">act in the right way</span>. I’d also agree with Jed that I think <span class="highlighted" id="node164_165634868933432116">the language of U-turns and all of these kind of brick bats that we throw at politicians often means that we just don’t get to the right answer</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node171_165634868933432116">what’s important is we get to the right answer</span>. So, I’m pleased that <span class="highlighted" id="node179_165634868933432116">we did, I think it’s the right thing</span>. I’m pleased that <span class="highlighted" id="node187_165634868933432116">Marcus showed our profession in the light that I see it every day</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node200_165634868933432116">long may it continue</span>. And<span class="highlighted" id="node212_165634868933432116"> long may the government, any government that we have, continue to listen to the right arguments</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node225_165634868933432116">make the right decisions</span>.</div><div>Fiona Bruce[00:04:59] And<span class="highlighted" id="node237_165634868933432116"> one of the things that was so compelling about Marcus Rashford was because he was talking about his own experience of poverty as a child</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node259_165634868933432116">going to friends’ houses when food was short in his own home</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node276_165634868933432116">Are there other footballers that you know that have lived that kind of life experience</span>?</div>
