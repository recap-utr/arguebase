I think <span class="highlighted" id="node806_165550239185553692">we're in the top five and we bring it down to 0.5%</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node817_165550239185553692">The majority of developed countries, something like 40 countries, are nowhere near 0.5%</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node824_165550239185553692">those countries include USA, Japan, France, Greece, and many, many others who don't come near 0.5%</span>, and we're going to bring our target down to 0.5%, <span class="highlighted" id="node831_165550239185553692">if we add our vaccination programme to the world, it is possible our contribution will go up way above 0.7%</span>.
