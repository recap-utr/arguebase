We talked about black moths became more common after pollution and how Larmack was dismissed because there is no way for say a giraffe parent to pass on the fact it was always stretching its neck to its offspring. This was hardly contraversial and the television teachs me far more anyway. How was evolution presented at your school.",

I recall a disclaimer at the start of the section, but I don't recall the exact wording. -Mach",
