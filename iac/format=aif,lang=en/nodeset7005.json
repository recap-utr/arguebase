      "text": "Just a guess on my part. But it's probably one of the only factors that separates our advanced industrialized nation -- as the only one still having the death penalty -- from savage places like Afghanistan, etc. Having a doctor allows the self-deceptive veneer that a most uncivilized, inhumane act, about to take place, is somehow civilized or humane. And not the bloodthirsty, venomous, purely vengeful thing that it is. He sounds like a very principled individual to me. With this, yet one more indication that the death penalty system in our country is unsustainable. Not only for moral reasons, but because it is not shown to serve as an effective deterrent, and because the overwhelmed system is not supportable, under our American Constitution, often punishing everyone involved, even the families of victims. (i.e. These cases go on for years and years and years and years. There's no closure for people.)",
