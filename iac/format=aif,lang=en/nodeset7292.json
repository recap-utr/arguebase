I know that it's more useless than tits on a man but hon, you gotta open your mind and heart up to the uber-natural farces that permiate the other semi-non-existing planes of being.

Something about not wanting to see your investment go to waste...or was it not wanting to be proven to be a fool who fell for a scam... But, psychologically putting money on it seems to help you believe.",
