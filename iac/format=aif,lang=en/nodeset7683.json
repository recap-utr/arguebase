It was an issue directly about people. But the subject of the gay marriage issue is marriage itself: should it remain traditional or not? Gay people would probably have much more success in lobbying for benefits in the form of civil unions.",

It wasn't an issue about people. Those seats at the back of the bus were just as comfortable as the seats at the front. No need for blacks to complain about being at the back of the bus. They could learn at black schools, and don't have to be in white schools. Blacks could eat just as well in the 'colored' dining rooms. They didn't have to be at the 'white' eating counter. Inter-racial marriage was not about black people, even though they were forbidden from marrying a white person, it was about marriage.",

Your point about gay rights groups perhaps endorsing a Democrat out of blind party loyalty over a pro- gay marriage Republican is an interesting point.
