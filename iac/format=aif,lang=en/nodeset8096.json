But I actally disagreewith 'consciousness' being a necessary quality of 'human beings', since it's unreasonable to believe that we stop being people when we go to sleep. But maybe you have a more nuanced definition of 'consciousness'.  Same as above, do you believe that a person in a coma is no longer a 'Human Being' ?  --",
