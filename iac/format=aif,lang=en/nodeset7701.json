      "text": "Steeeeve, ALABAMA voted out 'miscegenation' in 2000 'by act of legislature'. http://www.usatoday.com/news/vote2000/al/main03.htm Loving v Virginia ruled Alabama's law as unconstitutional over 30 years prior. The truth is that when the court notes that a law is unconstitutional, the law becomes unenforceable. The COURT does not remove the law from the books. The legislature must accomplish that act by its actions. But the action of the court, invalidating the law, PRECEDES the action of the legislature... I am asking about states where the legislature, without having the courts already striking down the law, took it upon themselves to remove the miscegenation law all by themselves. That is the point.",

      "text": "And I'm saying all but 16 states had already had the law removed before the Loving case. Most of these were done via the legislature and very few had the law overturned by a court. In fact, only California comes to mind as a state that had the statue overturned by the courts instead of on repeal by the legislature.  Who knew...but there is a wikipedia page on this: Anti-miscegenation laws - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia It doesn't say whether or not it was via a court case or not but I know that California was a court case and Massachusetts and many Northern/mid-west state were via legislature action. Also, the Supreme Court case ruled the Virginia law unconstitutional not the Alabama law. It is just understood that similar laws will be overturned thus they are negated.",

Considering the opposition to interracial marriage was THREE to ONE AGAINST, it's hard to believe that a state legislature would just decide to buck the electorate and legislate the laws away of their own volition.",
