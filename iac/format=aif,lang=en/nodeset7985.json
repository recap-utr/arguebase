These are in regards to providing for the pregnant couple the services they need. I also think some 'PR' work would need to be done to accomplish the destigmatization of unwed mothers so they really felt like they could unshamefully carry a child to term. Of course, I understand some folks think that they should be ashamed to be having sex outside of marriage, but the point here is to decrease the need for abortions. Get rid of the reasons why people have abortions and then ban abortion. Anyone want to live in Utopia? :xbanghead",
