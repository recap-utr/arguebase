Because every creationist I have seen on this board has used the creationist definition of evolution which non-creationists flatly reject and it wastes time. The replys to this very thread show that many people know the correct defintion of biological evolution and do not tolerate any other definition. If someone says the big bang people have to say the big bang and not the 'evolution of the universe' because it will just waste time.",

That is the definition I learned some decades ago, it is the one I have always used, and it is the one that I still find in modern biology texts. It is also the one that all biologists that I know use, and of course the meaning definition of what evolutionary biologists mean when they talk about evolution should be determined by evolutionary biologists themselves. It seems kind of an empty exercise to invent a definition that isn't what evolutionary biologists mean and then argue against it in an effort to disprove evolution. Let me put it this way, do you think that it would be acceptable in a discussion of Christianity if I were allowed to invent my own definition of what a Christian means when he talks about salvation? So please, please tell us about some of these changing defintions. Like I said, I've been using the same one for over 40 years and wasn't aware that it had changed.",
