Honestly though, do you think you would care more if it were blacks or jews being killed rather than feti and embryos? I'd certainly hope so...if you condemn abortion clinic bombers you are setting a certain double standard. I just don't think that a potential person can ever outweigh the wants and needs of an existing one, and 99% of the time pro-lifers agree. Soon as you realise that its not actually 'babies' being aborted then its a lot harder I think to hold a universally pro-choice opinion",

We have no problem with ending billions of lives over the course of our lives, if we don't think that they matter (cooking and even having food, having an immune system, disinfectants etc). If you don't recognise the organism as something worth worrying about, why would you? I say that its more likely that its more an embarrasment for most people than a feeling that they have killed someone (though to be fair, I can't back that up).",
