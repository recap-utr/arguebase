      "text": "A large fraction of the noncoding part of a eukaryotic genome is used to make RNA that is sufficiently stable in a cell to be detected by different technological approaches (1-4). The biological significance of this pervasive transcription is unclear and controversial. One possibility is that only very short regions of such unannotated RNA are biologically relevant (5). In-depth characterization of RNAs as to their subcellular compartmentalization, size, modifications, and genomic origins can potentially provide clues to their functions. This study reports two general observations derived from the maps of nuclear and cytosolic polyadenylated [poly(A)+] RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides (nt) (long RNAs, lRNAs) and whole-cell RNAs less than 200 nt (short RNAs, sRNAs) over the entire nonrepetitive portion of the human genome. First, the potential biological function of an appreciable portion of long unannotated transcripts is to serve as precursors for sRNAs. Second, these maps reveal three classes of RNAs that have specific genomic localization at gene boundaries. Biological relevance of these classes of RNAs is supported by strong correlation with the expression state of genes they associate with, as well as their syntenic conservation between human and mouse.",

Gingeras1* Significant fractions of eukaryotic genomes give rise to RNA, much of which is unannotated and has reduced protein-coding potential. The genomic origins and the associations of human nuclear and cytosolic polyadenylated RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides (nt) and whole-cell RNAs less than 200 nt were investigated in this genome-wide study. Subcellular addresses for nucleotides present in detected RNAs were assigned, and their potential processing into short RNAs was investigated. Taken together, these observations suggest a novel role for some unannotated RNAs as primary transcripts for the production of short RNAs. Three potentially functional classes of RNAs have been identified, two of which are syntenically conserved and correlate with the expression state of protein-coding genes. These data support a highly interleaved organization of the human transcriptome.",
