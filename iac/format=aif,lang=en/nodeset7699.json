So from conception one certain individual is forming and most likely will be born if the pregnancy is allowed to proceed (the majority of pregnancies allowed to proceed result in a live, healthy baby). Now, if the mother chooses to abort that person will not be born. You or I would not be here if we had been aborted. And why not? Because that person's life was ended while still in the womb.  Consider that person whose life was ended by abortion. How is abortion not killing? Why does it not matter to you that a life is ended by abortion? Even if it was just a clump of cells (I can hear this one coming) in the beginning, the fact is, in the end it will most likely be a live human being and that isn't changed by it's alleged 'clump of cells in the beginning' status. Please explain. :)",
