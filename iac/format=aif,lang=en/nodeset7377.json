The chilling ambush attacks on family homes in Trafalgar, on August 19, and Hampton Park, in June, are almost identical, with a crew of five masked men storming both houses in search for guns.  In the Hampton Park attack, a woman and her three teenage children were tied up as their father was made to open a safe containing $25,000 worth of high-powered pistols.  At the Trafalgar home, a woman, eight months pregnant, was pushed to the ground and bound as her husband was forced to retrieve $10,000 worth of guns from a safe and hand them over.",

A Heckler and Koch MP5 9mm submachine gun - capable of firing 800 rounds a minute and used by armed forces and police in 40 countries - was also found, police said. Among the guns allegedly bought from the gang was a World War II Bren Light machine gun capable of firing up to 520 rounds a minute.
