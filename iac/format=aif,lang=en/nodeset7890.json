Catholics had to steal hellfire to scare all the converts from not caring if they went to heaven. Take away hell and heavenly bliss what do most people see as a reason for worshiping god?  People hate totalitarian governments yet God advocates one. Except for the middle east nobody is preaching the virtues of a church state anymore. The only reason really to worship god may be for social change. If enought people convert to a single denomination they can live the way they think is best with out being humiliated or worse.",
