I suppose, even being a pro-lifer, that I could get behind justifying an abortion due to rape in consideration of the unwilling, violent conception and the mental trauma of the mother BUT I think that the rape should be reported within 24 hours for the person to qualify for this 'loophole.' It should be reported BEFORE the victim is aware of any pregnancy. Coming forth weeks or months after the fact is too suspicious and gives the appearance that they are just crying rape as an excuse for a justified abortion.",
