So if I own a business I get to fire someone because they are christian, jewish, conservative republican, muslim, or any anti gay person. I think you would have no problem with this solution.",

If you dislike this and go against it your not a true Amercain. IF you say that same sex marriage is against the Bible your not a true Amercain. This country is built to go against having the church run everthing. So tough it, if men and women want to have same sex and marry each other, thats their choice and by Amercains we will honer their RIGHT!!! to do so! Thank YOU",

But now that homosexual sinners are coming out of their closets like the brazen hedonists that they are, we're regressing back to Sodom and Gomorrah values. Americans reject gay marriage. It's a perversion and an abomination.",
