      "text": "Actually, Darwin was much less racist than was typical of the Victorian British of his day. Possibly you should read what Darwin had to say about his encounters with slavery in South America. Nevertheless, Darwin was a Victorian Englishman and his attitudes were colored by that culture, where Victoria was, by the Grace of God, Queen, and the head of the Church of England, which dominated the culture and academic life of the time. You know, the slavery that was propagated and approved by the European Christian churches. And, of course, the slave trade in the U.S. was supported and approved by the protestant churches. The Southern Baptist Convention was formed for the sole purpose of excluding blacks from the Christian churches. In 1997 the Southern Baptist Convention issued an official apology to African Americans for its history of racism. Of course, you are probably quite aware that the KKK was fromed by southern Christians - still is. There is also the Aryan Brotherhood, which also claims to be Christian. So I guess we could call that proof of the racism of Christianity. Of course you will squeal and cry about it and offer excuses, but facts are facts.",
