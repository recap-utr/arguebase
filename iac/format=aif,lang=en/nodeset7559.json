It is interesting to note that creationist computer software developers/programmers cannot seem to agree on the implications of 'mutations' when using such analogies - one such person, C.K. Lester, declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30% 'random change', just like DNA (hypothetically) can, therefore, the computer analogy is a good one. But programmer R. David Pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it.",
