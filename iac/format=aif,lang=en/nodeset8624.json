His attack on unbridled capitalism and unregulated market forces .... his plea for financiers in particular to refocus on ethics .... Pope Benedict's emphasis on the need for 'forms of redistribution of wealth' is also likely to fuel the debate at the summit - to be attended by 39 heads of government and international institutions - over the failure of several rich nations, most notably Italy and France, to honour past aid commitments.",
