More people than ever are buying guns, including many first timers, because they know Obama will support whatever gun control gets through congress, and they don't like that. They know he's going to go back on his promises to hunters and sportsmen, and that's going to cost him big in 2012. This is going to be a very short reign for the democrats.",
