Creation scientists have proved that radioisotope dating is unreliable. 3 The two pieces are only assumed to be from the same individual. 4 Where's the conclusive DNA evidence? (A nod to easyrider on the Religion board.) 5 These claims are made by scientists, and all science is an atheistic conspiracy against religion (thank you marc9000). 6 So where's the missing link between the new fossil and us? Huh? Huh? Sadly, past experience suggests that creationists can wriggle on indefinitely.",
