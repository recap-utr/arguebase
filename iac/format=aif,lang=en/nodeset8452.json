      "text": "'Self-awareness' is not a strictly objective, scientific term. I recall reading in my college psychology textbooks that the concept labeled 'self-awareness' doesn't happen until many months after birth. At the end of the day, in order to answer the question, I think you'd need a pretty solid definition of self-awareness, and coming to agreement on what 'self-awareness' is or should be may not be an easy task. In a strictly biological sense, there is no debate that the biological life of a mammal begins at the point of conception/fertilization. There is no reasonable dispute to this observed fact. Only when subjective terms such as 'self-awareness' and 'personhood,' etc. come into play can there be valid debates. Show me a biologist or embryologist who states that the biological development of a unique mammal does not begin at conception/fertilization, and I'll show you a semantics game. ;)  It is perfectly valid for someone to have the opinion that 'life' begins with recordable brain activity (as early as 40-days post-conception)... or 'self-awareness' or any other such concept, or when the entity would be 'viable' outside the womb. But there are varying levels of brain activity. There is no agreed upon definition of self-awareness. And viability is an ever-changing concept (a 12-week fetus was delivered recently in Minnesota, and as far as I know is still alive and doing well -- please feel free to update me if you have heard any other news). If we look to biology to answer the question of when a unique entity begins its biological development that will not end until it 'dies,' then the answer is conception/fertilization.",
