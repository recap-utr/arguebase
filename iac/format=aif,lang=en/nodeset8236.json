      "text": "Just a technical point. Evolutionary theory does not require that mutations should be random. Molecular geneticists are well aware that some genes in some organisms mutate more often than others; alternatively, some genes are conserved more strongly than others. It's just that hotspots apart, there is no evidence for result-orientated directed mutation of genes. Within certain constraints, they appear to be random, but evolutionary theory as such doesn't demand that they should be. Second, natural selection through competition for resources isn't the only force constraining evolution (though it is the major explanation of adaptation). There is also genetic drift which can distribute neutral mutations through populations, and there are probably also other factors such as structural constraints and canalisation affecting which mutations can see the light of day (i.e. get exposed to natural selection) and which will not.",
