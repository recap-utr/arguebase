Federal grants are going to help pay for them.  Every officer will be trained on how to use the new weapons.",

Can anyone explain to me why we have to ban 'assault weapons' because they are only designed to mow people down like blades of grass, yet we need to issue the same 'assault weapons' to our police for their safety? If they are used solely to kill large amounts of people indiscriminately, why do our police need them, unless it's to kill large amounts of people indiscriminately? How can you argue they ARE NOT needed, yet argue that they ARE needed? Which is it? Please explain yet another instance of anti-gun 'doublespeak'.",
