Salt Lake NAACP President Jeanetta Williams said she was 'furious' about the idea. 'It is not acceptable for the name John M. Browning to jointly share the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday,' she said. 'Dr. King was assassinated by a man using a gun. John M. Browning was a gun manufacturer. ... To me it's a very mean-spirited act.' King would probably be outraged as well, having said that by allowing guns to be 'purchased at will and fired at whim...we have created an atmosphere in which violence and hatred have become popular pastimes.'
