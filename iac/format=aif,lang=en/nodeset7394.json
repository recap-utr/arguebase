The bit about 'seeking out an abusive mate because they secretly feel they deserve it' is a bit hard to swallow though. Usually an abuser reveals himself as such after the woman is in love, committed, etc. I do believe that there is a cycle to it, though. If abuse is what you know, what you grew up with, than you are more likely to have it in your adult life - but I don't buy that women purposely seek it out.",

This is true for anyone though...often you are attracted to certain things.",
