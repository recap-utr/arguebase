God just as he answered me simply above , does not always explain in detail his ways to mankind. But my study and prayer tells me that babies born who live only a short while , may have been saved from worse fates that awaited them had they lived longer. They may indeed be the lucky ones who were so loved by God he craved to have them walk the earth only a short while to be counted among men, he knew thier souls were not in need of years of learning many of us must do on earth to evolve into who we become . They were simple , beautiful souls who did not reguire the rigors of the world to perfect them. hope that helps.",
