In my debate with him he said it would be alright if a group of arabs in body armor and heavily armed walked onto the plane as long as they had tickets for the flight. He didn't want their intentions questioned at all as to why they were doing what they were. He will defend the constitutional rights to no end but will ignore all logic in the process.",
