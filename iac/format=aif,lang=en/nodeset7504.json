For the month of January, 17 of the 31 minor surgical procedures here were done to repair the results of \u00c2\u201cincomplete abortions.\u00c2\u201d A few may have been miscarriages, but most were botched operations by untrained, clumsy hands.Abortion is illegal in Tanzania (except to save the mother\u00c2\u2019s life or health), so women and girls turn to amateurs, who may dose them with herbs or other concoctions, pummel their bellies or insert objects vaginally. Infections, bleeding and punctures of the uterus or bowel can result, and can be fatal. Doctors treating women after these bungled attempts sometimes have no choice but to remove the uterus.Pregnancy and childbirth are among the greatest dangers that women face in Africa, which has the world\u00c2\u2019s highest rates of maternal mortality \u00c2\u2014 at least 100 times those in developed countries. Abortion accounts for a significant part of the death toll.",
