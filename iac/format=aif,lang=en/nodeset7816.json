      "text": "Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement, including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture. While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice, the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally, as they would a science textbook. Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible - the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark - convey timeless truths about God, human beings, and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts. We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many different traditions, believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as 'one theory among others' is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator. To argue that God's loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God, an act of hubris. We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge. We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth.",

I mean if you cant take something as simple as what is said in genesis and beleive it then why the XXXX would people beleive in anything else the bible has to say? If there is falsehood in it then how can any of it be trusted? If the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark are just there to serve as the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. That is Absolutly ridiculous. Why stop with that? Why not continue on to say that the story of Jesus was jsut a way for man to relate to God? Oh but then it continues doesnt it? Yes it does! Nothing in the bible is to be beleived unless it is all beleived as a whole. It is torn apart.  You cannot pick and choose parts of this religion as it fits your needs. It simply must be all or nothing. Otherwise you are wasting your time.",

When I told this certain poster that I have known several clergymen from several Christian denominations who accepted evolutionary theory, that's what he told me.
