We're still in the process of spending around 3 billion to register all the firearms in Canada.emoticon_mad :xcensored  The announcement is a blatant attempt to garner votes in Toronto and Ontario, key election areas, where gun violence is highest. I have no use for handguns, and I don't even know anyone that would be directly affected by the ban, but it's a matter of principle. It's the first step on a slippery slope. We all know that the vast majority of gun crime is carried out with registered, legally obtained handguns. emoticon_rolleyes Therefore, banning handguns in Canada will surely solve the problem.  Where do they find the retards that dream this stuff up?  First of all, handguns are nearly impossible to obtain legally in Canada as it is, 95%+ of handguns used in crimes in Canada have been illegally smuggled into the country from the USA. Even the police forces are saying that the law is pointless as it would only serve to increase the smuggling of handguns from the US, and would likely not have any impact on the rate of handgun use in crimes. On top of that, it would no doubt be another extremely expensive venture.  There are times when I really question the intelligence of the average Canadian, especially those in Ontario and Quebec. Some of them need a dose of reality. Waxy",
