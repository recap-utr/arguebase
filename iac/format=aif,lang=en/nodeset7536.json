Saying that Jesus told you that all life is special doesn't comfort a rape victim, doesn't provide health care to a woman without it, doesn't feed a family if a single mom has to quit her job, doesn't provide an education if she has to quit school. Reducing women to pretty quote that is hung in your kitchen doesn't mean squat out in here in the real world, and it doesn't indicate that you get it, let alone care.",
