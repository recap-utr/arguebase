The guy tries to discuss science when he is so utterly lacking in basic science that he thinks that the earth spins to 'keep[s] the oceans from falling off towards the sun'... :xbanghead stormboy, there is a thing called gravity: it is what 'keep[s] the oceans from falling off towards the sun'.  Now please go away and get an education, then when you have even the faintest idea of what you are talking about (which you currently do not), come back and attempt to debate.

It's precisely because they don't have an answer to your question, that they make fun of it. It's a debating tactic. We have nothing in our experience that shows that a 'singularity' is possible, let alone plausible, but we are told to accept it as a reasonable explanation for the origin of the universe. You can accept it or not, but if you do, you'll be accepting it on a premise that has no more strength behind it than saying 'because I said so'. The question then becomes, 'What is the most reasonable explanation, chance or a creator God?' The fact is that the singularity theory militates against other accepted theoies of science such as the notion of cause and effect. This is common with evolutionary theory. It has no problem stepping out of the accepted norms of science and crucifying any idea that stands in its way, no matter how vaild that idea may be. After all, evolutionary theory must survive at all costs. It reminds me of the Dark Ages, when the Churuch ruled, only this time the high priests are the 'scientists'.",
