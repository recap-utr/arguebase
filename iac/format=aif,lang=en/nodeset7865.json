Don't expect post-ban prices to go down though, that's the current cost of parts. If anything, they'll go up due to lack of supply for a limited time.",

As a business person the only question is going to be if grandfather rights will again be available if new legislation is passed. I spoke with a gun dealer I know who said manufacturer distributors are already calling dealers trying to determine what post-ban demand might be for pre-ban configurations. Bushmasters will be selling like hotcakes.",

However, other than a full blow all out war on American soil where I had to defend myself, my family, or join the war effort and fight for the country (in which case the service would give me a gun) why would I want to own a bushmaster or AK47?",

I'm not saying someone uninterested in different weapons couldn't afford them, but if the interest isn't already there, it's doubtful any explanation would provide an answer to your particular question.",
