I tried so hard not to, but when the celebrant asked me to repeat after him, with the vows I wrote my self.....I tried and tried and tried, but couldn't speak. I was too moved by the moment and all I could do was cry.... I love my partner with all my heart....So I wanted to get through, I thought about our taxes (didn't work). So thought about everyone in their underware.....contrary to popular opinoin that doesn't work either..... I managed to get the words out (don't know how) just did! This marriage is just as perfect to us, and those that were our witnessess.....as any heterosexual wedding...... The rest of the night was blur, between 50 people wanting my attention and me being really buzzed on white wine.....oh my oh my.......I was pretty shocked! Marrige is what you decide it is, regardles if the gov was to see it....I am now married.....like it or not.",

And did you know that if it would be a penalty, you're free to simply not file your taxes jointly, which results in no penalty at all?

This of course doesn't factor in the countless other benefits of marriage, such as naturalization, food stamps, veteran's benefits, housing benefits, greater ability to take out a loan, visitation rights, property rights, etc.",

As feasible as that may be, marriage is too rooted in our American culture. For that reason it is best to truly offer rights to everyone as our constitution so rightly protects.",
