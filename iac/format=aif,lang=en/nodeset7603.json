In any case, if such decisions are made I'd rather have them made by democratically accountable government than private corporations. I live in a country with a very good, though not perfect, public healthcare system, and the system proposed in the US is not government run, by any stretch of the imagination. The government will not own the hospitals, employ the medical staff, pay for most of the medicine, that will all be done by private insurers and private hospitals still. My maybe vote therefore means I think the US system needs to be nationalised, it's much more efficient to do that.",

I think many sane people see the writing on the wall which shows this health care bill only gives you the costs of the current US system with the defects of a universal system.
