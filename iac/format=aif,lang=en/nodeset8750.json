I also still have the packet for a similar 35% cocoa solids Dominican bar, made in Germany. Have to say that on balance I prefer the Ecuadorian bar, much deeper flavour. Hershey's is repulsive, and snickers is bland and greasy.",

European chocolate is supposed to be better but I don't have the taste buds for it...but I still like it. Plus Hershey Park was fun as a kid.  Now can we please stay on topic and talk about candy?",
