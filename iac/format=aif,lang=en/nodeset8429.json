Well all that came to a crashing halt when the Human Genome Project showed that the one-gene/one-phenotype concept was indeed a fairytale. Instead, to the shock and dismay of teary-eyed evolutionists, they found that the human genome only has about 25,000 genes - over 100,000 short of their estimate. This meant their theory about how they thought life worked had to be scrapped.",
