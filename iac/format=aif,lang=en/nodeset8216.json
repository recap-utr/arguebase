Pro-life should be about safe sex, peace, stem cell research, exercise, healthy eating and pollution control. As of yet, I've never seen a Pro-life rally against obesity -- which kills more than any abortion clinic. It truly is 'Anti-Abortion' and some can argue that it is 'Anti-Choice.' The reason it's not call anti-anything is because the prefix 'anti' implies a negative, and all of our connotations make it a bad thing. No one wants to be anti-choice. And seriously, other than people who directly profit from it, who is 'pro-death?' As for the original post, it seems that story is more about some African women not knowing how to deliver babies, or prevent them.",
