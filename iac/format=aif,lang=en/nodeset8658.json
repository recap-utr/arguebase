Approximately 13,000 Jewish residents were killed during the uprising (some 6,000 among them were burnt alive or died from smoke inhalation). Of the remaining 50,000 inhabitants, most were captured and shipped to concentration and extermination camps, in particular to Treblinka. ... According to the Stroop's report, his forces suffered 16 killed in action and 86 wounded (these figures included over 60 members of Waffen-SS, and did not include the Jewish collaborators). The real number of German losses, however, may be well higher if unknown. For the propaganda purposes, official German casualties were claimed to be only few wounded and none killed, while the Polish underground bulletins claimed that hundreds of Nazis died in the fighting.",

It's stupid and useless, but there are a lot of ingenious people out there that can probably prop up something to shoot one down, that's for sure. The second amendment is about self defense regardless of how big or small the threat is. I would think you would appreciate the ban on machine guns, since they are acknowledging that there is line to draw when it comes to it (like you can't own a fighter jet with military armament and just like the 1st Amendment you can't yell fire in a crowd.) Isn't this what most 'living document' people say? Oh, I get it now? It's not about that is it? The fact of the matter is, you are dissatisfied that the line wasn't drawn to limit even more of it, i.e. a complete ban on firearms, only the national guard or armed forces should have them. Sorry, but if you were to do that, it would open up another can of worms in which would mean that all other confirmed rights could be limited even more. The SCOTUS did the right thing in this instance because they acknowledged there is a line to be drawn, but not the one that prohibits all law abiding citizens from owning firearm.",

The explosion from the grenade would cause the shell in the tanks barrell to also explode, and then the rest of the ammo in the tank, and wallah, dead crew and no more opperable tank. As far as a plane is concerned, almost all of todays planes are controlled by computers, at least the guidance and weapons systems, so I would try to bring a plane down with a simple computer. You tell one planes weapons to target another plane, and boom, one less plane. Or one might dig a trench with which to trap a tank, and after a tank falls into the trench and gets stuck, you kill the exiting soldiers, pull the tank out, and now you have your very own tank.
