However, a person's right in choosing what is best for them is not something that should ever be restricted. If there are consequences for our actions, we should be prepared to accept them, either in the eyes of the law, or in that god fellow so many people talk about. What did he say? Judge not lest ye be judged? Now I don't know if that god fellow is for real or not, but those sound like pretty good words anyway. There were some very learned people who wrote in the bible. It's too bad that society has forgoten some of the lessons handed down to use over the last 2000 years.",
