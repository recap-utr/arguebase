All science, all engineering, all manufacturing, and most other human endeavours are equally naturalistic.

We want to bring a different set of values into being, to bring about a new set of ruling ideas&#8212;ideas of a society without rulers, a part of a different ideology or world-view. We want to bring about a socialist society. It will, if we are vigilant, have a socialist science. I can imagine it, or some of it.'

'In short, the triumph of Darwinism implied the death of God and set the stage for replacing Biblical religion with a new faith based on evolutionary naturalism. That new faith would become the basis not just of science but also of government, law and morality. It would be the established religious philosophy of modernity.' (Fr.

'The current controversy is largely a reflection of different scientific philosophies, linked to ideas about race through their treatment of variation. But there is more to it. Even if they have no conscious social agenda, scientists are bound by the same preconceptions as everyone else - their social, religious, and educational backgrounds influence their choices of theories and, perhaps more important, their philosophies of science. Karl Popper noted more than once that it doesn't matter where hypotheses come from, only whether they explain the evidence they are based on, wether they are subject to disproof, and whether they can hold up to enthusiastic attempts to disprove them. This philosophy forms the basis of deductive science. But hypothesis do come from somewhere, often the underlying assumptions of society. Moreover, not only the differences in sources of ideas, but also different premises scientists have held about evolution, human nature, God, and how science should be done, have always underscored the controversies about human evolution.' Wolpoff, M & Caspari, R, (1997) 'Race and Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction', p12. I have been at pains to quote this, not because their work is in the field of epistemology (for when I post evidence, from epistemological sources, I get the reaction I just got from you; 'too much information'/'irrelevant to scientists!' These evolutionists recognise the variety of influences, not all affecting us all on a conscious level. You simply ignore this evidence and present a statement that you don't believe it. Further I find it odd people should demand that I cease quoting from outside sources to back up my statements.",

I know that all the evidence points to creation, i.e. the creation interpretation makes more sense than the evolutionary interpretation. There is very good evidence to suggest the existence of God, for one, the fact that we are all still here is one. If there were no God, than this whole universe would cease to function. I believe the laws of nature and our sciences are man's attempt to describe the normal ways that God upholds His creation. When He acts differently, a miracle occurs. Of course, this is based on the belief that the Bible is true. Many other great scientists, including Newton and Galileo also seemed to believe that science and Christianity were compatible.  Reason stems from the belief that the universe is orderly, rational and logical. By the dictionary, reason is the intellectual faculty by which conclusions are drawn from premises. Now, if we are accidents of pure chance (which evolution teaches) than the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. This is just to show that with evolution, you can't be sure of anything, because everything is just an accident. But with an orderly and rational Creator, you can be sure of things and be able to reason.",

      "text": "Actually, the whole basis for modern science depends on the assumption that the universe was made by a rational creator. Dr Stanley Jaki has documented how the scientific method was still-born in all cultures apart from the Judeo-Christian culture in Europe (Science and Creation (Edinburgh and London: Scottish Academic Press, 1974)). An orderly universe makes perfect sense if it was made by an orderly Creator. But if there is no creator, or if Zeus and his gang were in charge, why should there be any order at all? Loren Eiseley stated (Loren Eiseley: Darwin's Century: Evolution and the Men who Discovered It, Doubleday, Anchor, New York (1961): 'The philosophy of experimental science...began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith, not the knowledge, that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces He had set in operation... It is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science, which professionally has little to do with faith, owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted, and that science today is sustained by that assumption.' C.S. Lewis also pointed out that even our ability to reason would be called into question if atheistic evolution were true (God in the Dock (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1970) pp. 52-53): 'If the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision, then the appearance of organic life on this planet was also an accident, and the whole evolution of Man was an accident too. If so, then all our thought processes are mere accidents-the accidental by-product of the movement of atoms. And this holds for the materialists and astronomers as well as for anyone else's. But if their thoughts-i.e. of Materialism and Astronomy-are merely accidental by-products, why should we believe them to be true? I see no reason for believing that one accident should be able to give a correct account of all the other accidents.' Further more, on what basis can we study the world in any coherent way and come to sensible conclusions about it?",

Similarly, evolutionists must also take the supposed progression of life from simple to complex by faith, as we were not there to observe the events happening and they certainly cannot be repeated today.  If someone gives you an eye witness account of an event that happened before your time and all the evidence that you have collected does not contradict that account, is it no logical and rational to believe that eye witness' account? In a similar way, we have the Word of our Creator who doesn't lie and who was there in the beginning. The actual physical evidence fits nicely with what we would expect if the Bible is right, e.g. fossils, mutations, the fact that there are billions of sea things burried in massive 'underwater graves' all over the Earth - some while still eating or giving birth (i.e. had to be rapid). So if the evidence that we have collected does not contradict what His eye witness account says (i.e. Genesis) than, is it not logical and rational to believe it to be true? In fact, it would be illogical and irrational to not believe it!",

      "text": "This is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture. One of the most astonising 'proofs' if you will, that the Bible is of supernatural origin, is predictive prophecy. Science cannot, as you claim, 'explain' everything, and it has no natural explanation for the predictions made in scripture. How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass? Also, how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people (uneducated in the ways of modern science) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today. How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently? Ecclesiastes 1:6 The wind goes toward the south, And turns around to the north; The wind whirls about continually, And comes again on its circuit.  How did they know that the earth 'hangs on nothing' when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility? Job 26:7 He stretches out the north over empty space; He hangs the earth on nothing.  How did they know that the 'vapors' of the earth rise to create moisture, that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil? Jeremiah 10:13 When He utters His voice, There is a multitude of waters in the heavens: 'And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain, He brings the wind out of His treasuries.'  Hydrothermal vents[4] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BC-more than 3,000 years before their discovery by science. Genesis 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.  Even though the Bible is not a scientific text book and doesn't purport to be, nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate. In addition, many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible. It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them. The story goes 'They (scientists) are slowly working their way to the mountain's peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take. After many years of research, they finally arrive at the top of the mountain, scale over its leading edge, only to find a group of theologians sitting there with the answers all along.'",

For example, if you go into your room and just mindlessly throw everything around accidentally without planning where it will go, it will not create a nice clean room. No, it will create disorder. Accidents will never create order. Car crashes, for example, do not create order. Think about this, you have bits and pieces of car for over a hundred metres depending on the severity. I'ld hate to be involved in one like that!  If you want your room to look orderly, you must carefully plan where you want to put all of your possessions, where they will look neat and tidy. Hence, intelligence creates order. Therefore, an orderly universe cannot come about by accident and thus requires intelligence, i.e. God.",

      "text": "Actually, all evolutionists must have faith for their theory to be true. Can you prove that the big bang happened 15 billion years ago? No, all the evidence that we have in favour is the red shift of starlight and the background microwave radiation (which is all at the same temperature, give or take a few K). We all know how evolutionists interpret the evidence, but the evidence makes just as much more sense when interpreted through Dr Humphreys' new young earth relativistic cosmology model. This is outlined in his book 'Starlight and Time' and is an amazing read. So the same evidence (e.g. redshift, CBM radiation) makes sense in both models (although CBM causes a little trouble in the big bang theory).  But we have no human eye witness accounts of the big bang or even creation unfolding. Nor we can observe life coming from lifeless chemicals, nor we can observe life going from simple to complex - today we observe mutations and natural selection going in the opposite direction. Basically, no one was there to see the supposed evolution of all things. We have no eye witness accounts of any of these events, they certainly cannot be repeated or experimented upon today. This means that the evolutionist must take his belief in evolution by faith as he cannot prove that it happened here today in the present.",

By definition of reason, it is the intellectual faculaty by which conclusions are drawn from premises. On the existence of a rational Creator who made us in His image, our 'intellectual faculty' would also be made in His image. Thus it is rational and logical. Hence, the conclusion that we come to from the premise that God exists is rational and logical. While evolution says we are accidents, and hence, our brain patterns that governs our logic and ability to reason must also be accidnets (i.e we would be irrational and illogical). After reasoning, the conclusions we came to would be most likely irrational and illogical. As you can see from the definition of reason, it depends on your starting faith or belief systems as to what conclusion you will come to. Another word for this faith is assumptions.",
