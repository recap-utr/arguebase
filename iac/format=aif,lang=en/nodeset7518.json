Another thing, if you give teenagers the option to have an escape goat for getting pregnant at an early age. They'll never learn!  Life is life and you take whats handed to you. If you try and change that, you get a screwed up place(hince the world). But thats just my opinion.....",

(Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center of the National Victim Center, 1992).' Now these women and teenagers that may have had a great life. They may have had a dream of becoming someone. They may be a good student at a good high school or college. They have been waiting all of their lives for. But...But but but...all of those dreams, goals, intentions, emoticon_xkill all shot down because some guy couldnt control his hormones and made them pregnant. Not only does that destroy you mentally. It also destroys you physically. They have to have this baby because they could not get an abortion and have that fetus, which was not their's to want, could save a life of a person. They could save them from: cancer, bone thinning, organ failure etc. But no..no...no...no...because people think that only teens are just fooling around and not thinking and having unprotected sex. They should make abortions illegal. Thats definatly not my opinion",
