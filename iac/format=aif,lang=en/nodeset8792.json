      "text": "Lets say that at some point in the near future a world was found on which lived beings with an intelligence and self awareness like our own along with society, religion and culture. These Beings have a religion that contains a story that says their world was created by a deity 3000 years after when literal Genesists say the earth was created (ie. if now, this would make their universe 3000 years old). When the religious members of each race discover the others beliefs, it causes much consternation as both claim to have the truth of God on their side. How would each group of literal belivers react to the other? the Genesists say the Beings story cannot be correct because the Bible is the word of God and it records 6000 years of history. The Beings cannot accept the history of Genesis as it claims th universe existed 3000 years before their holy text records the creation of the universe and their first members by their God. Both claim to have the evidence of the word of God in their holy books, and their respective histories are truth. But their truth's disagree........ who is 'right' who has the real 'truth'?",

      "text": "Why even set this in sci-fi? We've got heaps of religions on the known world. Here's one for you... say a number of people entered a debate forum with the purpose of defending 'evolution' which follows 'scientific method'. They dispute religion because they say, 'if religion is true,....which one?'. Then someone shows them that evolution is not an homogenous theory; not only are there different modes of theories of evolution; materialism, ID-theory, etc, but even within their version (materialism) there's different conflicting theories, some of which are mutually exclusive. Further to that, many of their notions about science aren't scientific, but based on philosophies of science; such as their false belief that there's only one 'scientific method', or that materialism, itself, is the only method of evolutionary theory. And to top it all off, science can't actually determine what is true, anyway. So they're arguing against a belief in certainty from a belief in uncertainty. They deride people's beliefs in God, etc, as being irrational, or illogical, but don't even realise the faulty basis of their own assumptions about evolutionary science. How do they react to this revelation? I would guess that there would be howls of protests, lots of ad hominems etc. This of course doesn't disprove 'evolution', but they don't even look to that, they're too busy attacking someone who'd dare question their a priori notions about science. That is, in this 'hypothetic forum' I'm talking about :)",

      "text": "Reasonable people would look for justification for their beliefs. Many who have beliefs based on faith, however, accept things because they feel like accepting them. Including, absolute truths, and contradictions. The resultant SHOULD be peaceful acceptance because after all, they can both be correct, yet be in contradiction, according to faith-based belief systems. The reality would probably be, as you say, that they would mix up faith and reason and start claiming one is 'actually correct', and the other is 'The work of the devil', and proceed to clobber the other religion, absorb their members, abordb the traditions that were 'popular' from the other religion, rename them and re-color them to match their religion, and carry on proclaiming truth and the afterlife and mercy and whatever else pops into their heads. That's of course, based on what I've seen and read. -Mach",
