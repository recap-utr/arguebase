Secondly, there's a growing body of evidence to indicate that dinosaurs may have been warm blooded as well. It wasn't the cold per se that killed off everything, it was the fact that plants died off, disrupting the food chain. Anything that required alot of food, and anything human sized would have been included, was in trouble. As for the original question, it seems that even creationist have given up on persuing this line of inquiry. If creationists think something is too far fetched to consider, then you know it's really out there.",
