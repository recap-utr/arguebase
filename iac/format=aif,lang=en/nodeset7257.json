WHen it comes to evolution, the theory of evolution is a model to try to explain the observed fact that evolution happens.  Second of all, Humans and modern apes share the same ancestor. From a biological point of view, humans ARE apes that have a specialised brain. The third problem is many religious people take much of the bible as allegorical. That means they are able to reconcilate such things as scientific fact, (evolution, expanding universe, age of the universe, biology, geology and physics), and their belief in God.",
