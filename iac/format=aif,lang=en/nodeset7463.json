      "text": "You asked the question - why do people get upset by an everyday occurance. I answered. It is one thing for you not to believe it is a life - that is another argument. I mean, when my sister lost her dog, she just cried and cried. I didn't have any attachment to the dog - but I recognised hers. We pro-lifers believe that the aborted life is human life. So, you've seen no evidence of protestors helping these women - were they allowed in the clinics to talk to the women?",

      "text": "Actually Montalban, there is a federal ordinance requiring protestors to stay at least thirty feet from the clinic's property. Were they allowed to go inside and talk to the women? Of course not. Most of the rabid anti-abortionists, (the ones that show up outside the clinic with their disgusting signs and propaganda, shrieking at the women, throwing rotten fruit and worse at them) have absolutely no right to speak to these women, as their contact with them could be at the least disturbing and at the worst violent and dangerous. Thankful though I am for the ordinance, it is not enough, and in some cases, it is not enforced. There are cases of the police 'looking the other way' because they agree with the protestors. In my opinion, these protestors should be arrested and prosecuted for harassment, assault, unlawful assembly, and anything else we can pin on them. Yes, in america the first ammendment gives you the right to peaceful assembly and protest, and that right should be protected. But with any other protest, the organisers have to get the proper permits, and police have to be on hand in case anything gets unruly. The protests that occur outside a clinic are neither lawful, nor peaceful.",
