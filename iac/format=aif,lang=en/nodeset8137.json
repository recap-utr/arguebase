How come you haven't gotten back to me about the North Hollywood Shootout of 1997? Why haven't you confronted the fact that the AWB did nothing to stop two criminals armed with AK-47s from holding the entire California police force at bay? I don't know who's stupider, you or Galileo. What you're suggesting is like trying to stop bank robberies by banning the wearing of ski masks.",
