Since drug dealers can't go to the police or any other security agency for protection from their customers or competitors, they are forced to rely on their reputation for violence. Remove drug prohibition and you'd solve most of America's problem with murder. Within a year, there'd be no street drug trade. Sure, there'd still be drug addiction, but it would be a health and safety problem, like nicotine or alcohol addiction, not a murder problem.  Adding gun prohibition on top of drug prohibition is only likely to compound it.",
