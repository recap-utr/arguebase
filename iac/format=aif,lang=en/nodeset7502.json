God even says in the Bible that Jesus is his son so that they are apart of eachother but are not the same. Also, how do you know that a lot of the laws put into Leviticus were not just ones added by the chief priest? After all, the Bible was writen down by human hands. Also I want to make reference to John 3: 16-17 (TEV* translation) 16: For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not die but have eternal life. 17: For God did not send his Son into the world to be its judge, but to be its savior.     *I specify the translation because it seems that most of the posters are using KJV, which kind of annoys me when I try to read it.",
