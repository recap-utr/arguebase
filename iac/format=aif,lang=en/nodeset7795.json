How is it that 'the way he was brought up' is more important then protecting gay people?  What of they way gay people were brought up? What about the threat to our freedom that Brian Kolb and his evil religion and political party represents? I was brought up by my father, taught in school that all people are equal. His refusal to extend marriage to gay people is a threat to me and I do feel harmed and it is a challenge to the way I was brought up.  I do live in Michigan and not in New York but his evil statements and attitude are the same here if not worse. I was shocked to find out the Romney was the son of a former Michigan governor and that he is from Michigan. Does figure with all the anti gay religious nut cases that are swarming in the woods here in Michigan.",

I'm gonna have to say that if I was talking to the assemblyman that they quoted said that to my face, I'd tell the little bigot that his filthy viewpoint sounds exactly like the arguments used against interracial marriage, against civil rights for blacks, women, and various minorities, and also against ending slavery.",

Spitzer introduced the bill into the Legislature and a bit under a year since the NYS Court of Appeals ruled that it&#8217;s the Legislature&#8217;s job to decide on the issue of same-sex marriage. It's not likely the GOP senate will pass it, of course, but who knows? Maybe miracles do happen... :)",
