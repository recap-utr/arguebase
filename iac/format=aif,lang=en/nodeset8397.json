      "text": "As for who plays 'word-games', it seems that you missed this... #19 'New peppered moth stuff' He went on for some time trying to undermine my posts based on the use of a word which most people have a problem with. There's also the problem with Darwin claiming a tautology was a better term than 'Natural Selection', this was debated for some time, even though I posted the actual words of Darwin. The thread 'Unto the Ages of Ages' developed into a debate over whether something could be both ''more accurate' and wrong, thanks Ursus! WJA and SLP argued over the word 'applied', then 'published'; whether Dembski had, and then changed this to 'proved' (see 'Looking for intelligence' thread) Lurch/Ungerdunn etc over what is a 'noun'. Multiple personalities aside, this debate over 'nouns' lasted for months. He resorted to no better argument then 'you're wrong'. A great debating style! As for debating styles.... Waxy enters a debate on Science/Math says that I've been refuted somewhere else, by someone else, and then leaves; does the same thing on these Creation/Evolution debates... only adds a few insults in the process... not wishing to debate, just to name call. Mach is happy to admit he doesn't read my posts/skims over them but wants to both debate and not debate them - claiming he's got a time problem... and asks me to post stuff he's already replied to Would you count as a word-game the two incidents where you've made a claim about me being insulting, and when I've asked you to point it out, you can't? One time you were so flustered you told me you were going to warn everyone about me. You make allegations then don't back them up. Archilochus makes allegations that I don't understand the word 'chance' but is un-prepared to come up with a definition, just repeats that I don't understand it. He'll go on repeating this, because it is a replacement for debate. All the while you guys are very shy when it comes to debating each other's mistakes; such as Hank describing the world as egg-shaped, etc. In short you make so many 'just-so' statements with little recourse to evidence, in an effort to drown out anyone who differs in opinion from yourself. Hence the total unwillingness to seriously tackle anyone from your own side who is either a) wrong or b) rude But in short, if someone posts here a statement, and they can't even be sure what they mean by it, then it doesn't bode well. That is what has upset a number of people; when this has been pointed out. This is also why many pro-evolutionists are so quick to resort to ad hominem here. That's what this thread of yours is an attempt at - and at best it is something that suggests only other people are guilty of this crime.",

      "text": "No, I for one dislike your posts because I know you intentionally write irrational posts to help support your religious cause.  Just for the record montalban, basically every single legitimate scientist is 'pro-evolution'. Creation theory is not taught in public schools, not by chance, but because...*gasp* it's RELIGIOUS MUMBO JUMBO. There is no evidence to support it. Creation fiction has made no progress with it's 'faith-based' (lackofevidence) with rational people.  And I'll also say that I'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day. Ad hominem is just a lack of patience, or someone who doesn't care to hide their emotion or opinion. Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death. Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate. The irrational..well, why bother?  -Mach",
