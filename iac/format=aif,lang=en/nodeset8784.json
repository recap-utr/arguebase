      "text": "The stem cells that are used for such potentially life-saving procedures are at such an extremely early stage of development that there is no biological possibility that the beginnings of a mind exist. There is absolutely no feeling, no emotion, no thought, no sense of pain. The batch of cells is still an object. They are the very beginnings of the body where the beginnings of the mind (or, for that matter, a soul, if one is of the opinion that a soul must include some sense of mind) are very far off.  However, unless I am mistaken in the biology of this particular batch of cells, they could potentially develop into an actual person (where, for me, person means not only body but some sense of mind or soul as well). This sense of potential personhood should not be taken lightly. This would not be a case of a woman's right over her own body. This would be the case of deliberately generating living human cells (note: this is not equal to a living person) for medical reasons benefiting a living person.  In the balance of having some respect for the idea that these cells could potentially become a person (again, still far off from being actual people - i.e. starting to have a mind), I would only condone using such stem cells if it is a case of saving the life of an existing person - be it myself or anyone else. I would not, for example, condone use of stem cells to help alleviate a medical condition which is not life threatening.",
