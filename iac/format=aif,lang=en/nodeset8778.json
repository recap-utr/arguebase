'A gunman walked into a military hospital clinic at Fairchild Air Force Base where he killed four people and wounded 21 others using a Chinese-made MAK-90 semi-automatic assault rifle....Spokane County Sheriff Larry Erickson called the semi-automatic assault rifle a 'mankiller' and claimed it is likely far fewer people would have been hurt had another weapon been used. 'This [gun] gave him the capability to fire as fast as he could pull the trigger. And that's a lot of rounds when you've got a 50-round magazine.'

      "text": "Armour piercing ammo, 100% legal. Here is where you can buy SS109 armour piercing ammo: http://ammoman.com/  I agree, the Brady Bill is laughable to criminals who want the contraban items. You do not even have to buy them, you can make them yourself.  I agree that the cops are not the best protection. The best protection is YOU for YOURSELF. Only you are on the spot the quickest when you are threatened. Only you are able the judge quickest weather your saftey is threatened. Seach on any engine: police accidental shooting. It is quite alarming how many times cops shoot the innocent. If cops can get to a crime scene in time, they have to sort out the criminal and the victim very quickly under difficult conditions. In essence, they do not get the whole story, until it is over. You may even gen a criminal pretending to be a victim, only to shoot the cops in the back. That is why victims at the crime scene are the best judge of who needs to be shoot first. For my own personal situation, I do not recommend just buying a gun for protection. Also seek training and lots of it. Then practice, practice, practice, and then practice some more. No matter how justified you are defending your life with firearm, you must still defend your actions in a court of law, especially if human life was taken. I do not agree with people carrying firearms with no training. That is a very personal decision and I will not stop anyone from carrying a firearm if they choose to do so.",
