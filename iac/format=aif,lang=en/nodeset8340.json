It seems like it would be way too hard to do, but I still see more and more sad people choking on prayers. It's a shame to be so bent on shouting praise to a higher power and never getting the results one needs. That goes back to the 'feel good' god, or the 'I'm better than most' god. Looks like these people never get the desired results or else they'd stop and look at their fading gills.",
