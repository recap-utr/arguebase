One thing I learned a while back is that a conservative will rarely, if ever, post anything that is contrary to his or her beliefs and the same can be said for the liberal. Both sides take every advantage to post something favorable to their ideologies. There is no such thing as being unbiased when it comes to putting out the info. People in glass houses should not throw rocks. No side of the aisle is above this tactic. Including my own. Don't believe anything you hear or read and only half of the stuff you actually see for yourself.",
