      "text": "The term PACS stands for Pacte Civil de Solidarit\u00e9, which was introduced into French law on 15 November 1999. Put simply, a PACS is a contract signed by two people of the same sex or opposite sex, who are over 18 years old and want to organise their life together. It's an agreement that cannot be entered into by two people who are part of the same family, who are already married or who are already part of a PACS. The contract - which can prepared by the parties themselves or by their lawyer - is registered together with all relevant documents at the registered office of the civil court in the area where the couple live. ..................  The couple are free to detail their obligations to each other in the contract. But in any case by law they are obliged to help and assist each other.  The precise level of support is proportional to their income. The couple are jointly responsible for any debts incurred by the other through normal daily living - but not if those expenses are deemed excessive. All other debts remain an individual's personal responsibility.  Unless the couple have decided to hold their assets in common according to the system of 'indivision' - where each item bought after the PACS is signed is deemed to belong jointly to both of the partners - the estates of each partner remain separate. Each partner remains the owner of the assets he or she buys - and responsible for his or her debts.  The main advantages of a PACS are concerned with tax. The 'pacs\u00e9s' as they are known in France benefit from being taxed as a couple - and not as two separate individuals. This can often reduce their overall income tax burden And since August 2007, the surviving partner of a PACS benefits from the same inheritance tax regime as a surviving spouse in a married couple - which means there are no death duties to pay.",

      "text": "1) It's hardly 'solved'.Same-sex marriage is not legal in France. As of 2006, one same-sex marriage ceremony has been conducted in France and was declared void. France has a statute authorizing civil unions, known as PACS, between same-sex and unmarried opposite-sex couples. Same-sex marriage was an issue in the 2007 presidential election, with the Conservative UMP opposing it and the Socialist Party supporting it, though both candidates support civil unions (PACS). .... On June 5, 2004, former Green Party presidential candidate No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re, Mayor of the Bordeaux suburb of B\u00e8gles, conducted a same-sex marriage ceremony for two men, Bertrand Charpentier and St\u00e9phane Chapin. Mam\u00e8re claimed that there was nothing in French law to prohibit such a ceremony, and that he would appeal any challenge to the European Court of Human Rights. French Justice Minister Dominique Perben had stated that such unions would be legally void, and called for judicial intervention to halt the ceremony.Same-sex marriage in France - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia What France has is 'well, both the blacks and the whites can enter by the side-door, but only the whites can enter by the main door' We wouldn't find such an 'acommodation' satisfactory for blacks. And furthermore, I think you would find that it's the ANTI-GAYS who have the problem with this. If Obama is able to try to put up 'civil unions' on the federal level, you can bet dollars to doughnuts it will be the religious right who fight him. Not the gays...",
