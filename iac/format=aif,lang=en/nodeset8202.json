      "text": "In anthropology and biology, the term Evolutionism is nowadays used specifically for historical theories or beliefs of early sociocultural evolutionism developed in the 18th and 19th century that organisms are intrinsically bound to improve themselves through progressive changes that are heritable. This idea was applied to cultures and societies as well as to living organisms. The term evolutionist is still used more widely and can refer to proponents of the theory of evolution through natural selection which has superseded the earlier biological theories, but particularly in the U.S.A. this term is used by opponents of the theory to bolster their claim that evolution theory is a belief, or ideology (compared with other ideological 'isms'), rather than a science. The term is rarely used in the scientific community, as evolution is overwhelmingly accepted there. The terms are still used for theories about the development of cultures and civilisations.",

Likewise, creationsim isn't a religion, it's a belief based on religion. Sorry to be nit-picky, but precision in language helps in these sorts of discussions. Bascially you are right. Creationism is based on relgious beliefs and so teaching it in public schools in almost any scenario violates the constitution. Creationists keep repackaging it to try to make it seem non-religious, coming up with intelligent design, for example. However, courts keep ruling that it is illegal. I think the only thing you're missing is an understanding of how divorced from reality some creationists can be. They won't let a little thing like the law stop them from pushing their agenda.",

Board of Education (333 U.S. 203) Zorach v. Clauson (343 U.S. 306) McCollum found that religious instruction on school property is unconstitutional, while Zorach found that 'accommodating' religious instruction by releasing students from school for that purpose was not.",
