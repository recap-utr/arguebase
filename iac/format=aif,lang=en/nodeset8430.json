Your expression of machoism in the toughness of your truck is just another vanity. Vanity can be expressed by the pride one takes in the amount of mud hanging on the four wheeler after a spin in the backwoods. Face it, BO. You're just a vain man, such as I am. Our quest to have the biggest, baddest truck on the block is not much different from a woman wanting to be the belle of the ball. And often men express their vanity in the 'possession' of a trophy wife.",
