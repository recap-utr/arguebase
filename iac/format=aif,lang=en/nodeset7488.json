What trouble's me is that, if men had to go through what women did in pregnancy, the pro-life movement would be totally non-existant. Men are really not capable of being pro-life without being a hypocryte, as they have not experienced pregnancy. Why that is not true of the pro-choice side, is that we let the women choose, and she can choose both ways if she wishes. The pro-life movement involves force and blatant disregard for rights of the women, to the point of violation, yet the men have almost no knowledge of what it is like to get pregnant or have babies. Many pro-life men do know what raising a child is like, but they do not know what raising a child is like when you are a 14 year old girl with three kids already and no money. Yes, not all abortions go this way, but some do, and thats the point. You don't know every women's circumstances, and until you do, you are in no position to force her to abide by your morals, and thus harming her.",
