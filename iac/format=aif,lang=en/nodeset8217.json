I can't imagine an insurance company would agree to coverage of a person who found out he had cancer yesterday and applied for insurance today. They had mandates forcing this on them. Anyone who buys insurance has to make up the loss. There has to be another way to solve the problem.",

I'm afraid that too many people subconsiously think that conflicts between opposites like health providers (or trial lawyers) vs. insurance companies result in victory for the general public. Shandag's comments show that they both can have common interests (State mandates) that result in wins for both of them and a loss for the general public.",
