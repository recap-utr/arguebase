So matching any creation theory to genesis is impossible. Unless you believe God created the heaven and earth twice, and created animals twice. Sure you can explain it away, but a verbal reading of the ACTUAL TEXT will make your head swim.  I don't wana be sacrilegious, but some parts of Genesis makes God look like he was telling a fish story to a really dumb scribe too lazy to get on his camel and go to the library of Alexandria , or worse one of his interns. I am a irrational creationist btw.",
