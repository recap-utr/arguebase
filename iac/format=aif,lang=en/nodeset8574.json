Making a pistol with low chamber pressures, especially a semi or full auto firing from an open bolt, is no big deal to a competent machinist. Guns like the MC-10 are made mostly from stamped steel, simple to manufacture in a spare room. This all sounds like legislation of morality, proven to be impossible.",
