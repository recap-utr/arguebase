      "text": "You guys know me. Always happy to correct anyone. As electrolyte pointed out, (1) the first step in the scientific method is the observation. A scientist observes something that raises a question. (2) Then comes the hypothesis, that is an attempt to explain the observation. The hypothesis can be an educated guess or even wild speculation based on previous knowledge or intuition, or it may be based in previous science and an understanding of scientific principles. (3) One then makes a prediction that is a necessary consequence of the hypothesis. That science is predictive is one of its salient characteristics. In the case of the scientific method, the prediction is said to have the power to falsify the hypothesis. In other words, if the prediction can be shown to be false, then the hypothesis must also be false. If the prediction is true, then the hypothesis is supported. So now we have the observation, the hypothesis that explains the observation, and a prediction that is a consequence of the hypothesis. The next step (4) is to design an experiment to test the prediction, and then (5) to perform the test. If the prediction fails the test, then it may be abandoned. However, as electrolyte pointed out, the process may be circular, because if the prediction is falsified, additional observation from the test may be used to adjust the hypothesis at (2), and a new prediction is made at (3), and so on. In creation science, the process stops at (2), except that the hypothesis is based on dogma and scripture, not reality.",

Those who survive. But of course, 'survival of the fittest' isn't a very good statement of the theory of natural selection. Darwin didn't like it and only began using it due to the encouragement of Wallace after it had become popular. It first appeared in 'On The Origin Of Species' in the 4th edition, and it was never used without an explicit reference to natural selection. I never saw natural selection as being in the slightest tautological before. I too have found natural selection to be painfully obvious. I see what you are saying, but I don't actually see that as a tautology. Early on I learned that natural selection was differential reproductive success. Perhaps I had good teachers. In that light, natural selection is a statistical tendency for some genetic alleles to be passed along more than others. Once that concept was grasped, population genetics was a logical consequence.",
