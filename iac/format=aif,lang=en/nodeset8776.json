Upon Thee I was cast from birth; Thou hast been my God from my mother's womb. (Psalms 22:9-10) For Thou didst form my inward parts; Thou didst weave me in my mother's womb. I will give thanks to Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Thy works, And my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from Thee, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth. Thine eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Thy book they were all written, The days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was not one of them. (Psalms 139:13-16) Thus says the LORD who made you And formed you from the womb, who will help you, `Do not fear, O Jacob My servant; And you Jeshurun whom I have chosen. (Isaiah 44:2) Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, and the one who formed you from the womb, 'I, the LORD, am the maker of all things, Stretching out the heavens by Myself, And spreading out the earth all alone, (Isaiah 44:24)",

The traditional interpretation of this text, which even rabbinical scholars accepted for thousands of years, is this: if a man hurts a woman enough to cause a miscarriage, he reciprocates according to how much injury he caused her, i.e., an eye for an eye, etc. However, if the miscarriage resulted in no injury to the woman, then all the assailant had to pay was a monetary fine. The fact that the Bible does not equate the assailant's life with the stillborn's life is proof that the Bible does not count the fetus as a person. Further more we should have found replications of your contemporary translation since the copying of laws in the Middle East was widespread. Instead, the Assyrians, Hittites, Sumerians, Babylonians, Hammurapi and Eshnunna all have similar laws that go according to the traditional interpretation of it. Lastly, if a woman gave birth 'prematurely' back in Biblical ages it would have resulted in the birth of a stillborn. Saving premature babies is an achievement of modern science. Not God.",

She mentioned that she has recently become a Christian and that HER god is one that supports a womens right to choice. Now there are so many problems with this that I don't even know where to start. Not only that, I am saying this as almost a 'newbie' Christian as in I don't know everything there is to know about the Bible. However, I do know that the Christian God that is defined in the Bible is against abortion. Many argue that the Bible is not what the Christian God is because it has been translated into a meaningless document. How is this true when we have so many of the original scrolls? Moreever, how can one claim what God thinks if they don't have anything to base it on? For example if you say the Bible is worthless, you are a Christian, and God believes abortion is ok...then how did you come to this conclusion? The Christian God talks about how one is created before they were put in the womb. God also talks about not killing. So if you wish to be Christian and for abortion you need to rethink one of those stances. God doesn't conform to anyone.",

      "text": "Well here is a christian who supports abortion. I personally HAVE had an abortion. I had it several years, and while it was an extremely hard and emotional decision, I chose what was best for me. I was engaged (now married), and both my then-fiance and I were on birth control (I was on the pill and he used condoms). Unfortunately, despite those precautions, I became pregnant. We aren't that rich, and both of us our still finishing up our college degrees and are under enormous student loan burden. He supported my decision to abort as neither of us would have anywhere near the time or money to support a baby (hence our use of contraception), and neither of us have taken a full job in our fields yet to be able to provide that money to pay for the loans let alone a child. I think this is one of the many circumstances in which abortion is absolutely justifiable, especially because I think that except for rare circumstances, abortion should be allowed up to the third trimester (the exceptions would be if the woman's life was in danger, etc. for a later abortion). As to God not supporting abortion? Rubbish. If you'd like I could give you verses in which he not only supported abortions, but ordered forced abortions through his people (that is if you take the OT as literally true)",

Patrick Kennedy from receiving Communion, the central sacrament of the church, in Rhode Island because of the congressman's support for abortion rights, Kennedy said in a newspaper interview published Sunday. The decision by the outspoken prelate, reported on The Providence Journal's Web site, significantly escalates a bitter dispute between Tobin, an ultra orthodox bishop, and Kennedy, a son of the nation's most famous Roman Catholic family. 'The bishop instructed me not to take Communion and said that he has instructed the diocesan priests not to give me Communion,' Kennedy told the paper in an interview conducted Friday. Kennedy said the bishop had explained the penalty by telling him 'that I am not a good practicing Catholic because of the positions that I've taken as a public official,' particularly on abortion. Report: Kennedy barred from communion by bishop - Yahoo! News  Yes! Now do that with the rest of the Biblically-challenged, spiritually-inept Kennedy family, and all the rest of the pro-abortion Catholic democrats.",

      "text": "Let's see your best one (1) example.  In the meantime, you can revel in this: What does the Bible say about abortion?  'And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband may demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide. But if there is further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life.' (Exodus 21:22-23) Straight from the Jewish Torah, God immediately affirms the value of human life in a mother's womb. Next, a divinely appointed prophet from the womb: Jeremiah 1:5 - 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.' Psalm 139:13 - 'For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb.' Of course, the question here is: What divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mother's womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating?  That was a future prophet to the nations in the womb. But the pro-infanticide crowd wants to pretend that instead of a baby with a divine plan, it's nothing more than an unviable tissue mass. Well, God is not fooled, and neither are we. Finally, every time you see another child playing and laughing, every time you see a boy or girl graduate, get married, have their own child, and so on, I hope you see that innocent little baby you had ripped from your body.  I recommend you ask God / Christ to forgive you.",
