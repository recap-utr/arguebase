There was a hard core religious Christian who warned about the dangers of gambling even though he had a huge underground habit himself. While a hypocrite may be contemptable, that does not make their message wrong.",

The models for climate change that Gore recites are strictly weather and do not look at global climate patterns and do not look at climate changes within history. The changes that are occuring now are within the limits of changes that have happened elsewhere in history. His information is just a 'part' of the story. That is why he is incorrect.",
