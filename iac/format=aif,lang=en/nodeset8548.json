Go on, show us your argument against teaching kids about how this society organizes familes. Your opposition to this, homo- or heterosexual, is so obviously contrived. School is there to help socialize children and instruct them in how to be good members of this society, AND YOU KNOW IT. The idea that you would prefer them to ignore discussions of family -- while you simultaneously assert that this society rests on the family and tradition -- is ludicrous. Come on, jyoshu, you don't have to argue this one... we won't tell your supervisor.",
