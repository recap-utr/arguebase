The government as well as criminals who arent going to give up their guns in the first place would have total control over all of us because we would have no viable means in which to fight back, we would either have to obey, go to prison, or possibly die. I think it is a travesty that so many anti-gun proponents would spit in the faces of men and women who have fought and died to keep us free from such things by not only allowing this to happen, but they actually support it. Our service men and women didnt make those sacrifices just to protect us from foreign tyrants, but from any from within as well. These people need to wake up before it is too late and stop promoting the removal of what may be our most important right of all.",
