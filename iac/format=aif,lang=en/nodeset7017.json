But you Anti-Social, Socialist tyranny of a government ARRESTS and JAILS Tony Martin for the CRIME of SELF DEFENSE and they let the Burgular go free. Not only free but your courts deemed that Tony Martin Made the 'environment hazardous to the burgular trade' Tony Martin who has NEVER been charged with a crime is serving how many years? (10 plus?) while the HOME INVADER got out in less than 1 and continued his trade....... The problem though is that YOU worry about a 12 year old with a water pistol as opposed the the CRIMINAL invading your homes... You live in a Sick Sad World my friend.",

A singular instance that you quote is not an argument as anyone can just as easily find criticism with the USA over people freed early from jail. You will find black people over-represented in the jails of the UK, the USA and Australia. There is injustice everywhere.",
