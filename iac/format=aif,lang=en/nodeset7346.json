What is in the womb is not an 'infant' (your overly emotional non-argument nonwithstanding). I do have compassion... for the woman.  'outraged that the human race allows it to continue'? No, not really. I understand what motivates people. There are certain things that I feel are disgusting and would stop if I were able to. I don't think there is one thing I am passionate about over all else, but this issue does rank above many others. I feel disgusted that there are those who would make women second class citizens.",
