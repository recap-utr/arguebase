      "text": "'I survived an abortion attempt'  Gianna Jessen's mother was seven-and-a-half months pregnant when it was decided to abort the foetus she was carrying.  A saline solution was injected into Gianna's mother's womb, which doctors thought would kill the foetus within hours.  This time, most unusually, the procedure failed and Gianna was born alive, thanks in part to a shocked nurse.  She was so taken aback by Gianna's live delivery that she summoned an ambulance to whisk her from the abortion clinic to the hospital.  She weighed only two pounds at birth and needed to stay in hospital for nearly three months.  In an ironic twist of fate the abortionist had to sign her birth certificate.  Now American-born Gianna, aged 28, is in London to give her message against abortion.",
