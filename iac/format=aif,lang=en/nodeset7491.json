      "text": "I reckon that evolution is still just a theory for a valid reason. It is untrue and cannot be proven. Darwin himself said that his theory would be proven or disproven based on the future discovery of transitional fossils. There have been NO such fossils ever found. That being the case, even Darwin agrees that the theory of evolution is just man's folly. Ya'll can write millions of words about evolution, but what you lack is the proof of one discovery of transitional fossils The fact of the matter is that God created man in his own image. Case closed.",

      "text": "JUST A THEORY do u even know what a theory even is? You are just using the same strawman argument. U seem to know very little about science. THere have been many transitional fossils. you just seem to ignore facts after fact. You say we cant prove evolution nor produce any kind of evidence for transtional fossils yet you just accept God created everything without proving that to be true yourself. I may not have a brain but you just prove that people without brains may be smarter than some people who do have brains.",
