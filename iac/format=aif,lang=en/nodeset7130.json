      "text": "And here is the crux of the matter where I think Libertarians are missing it: As one Founding Father said, 'There can be no liberty without virtue.' Someone else once said, 'Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their bindings'.  If the God of the Bible is right, a nation which legalizes sin and intemperance loses the favor of God. And when the sins of a nation reach their fullness (in God's eyes), that disfavor can turn to judgment (Genesis 15:16, Deuteronomy Chapter 28 - 'The blessings of obedience and curses of disobedience). Therefore, while many of the Libertarians mean well on liberal social issues, they nevertheless either don't see the big picture, or they don't believe it will occur.",
