Old age,disease,accident,using drugs (and yes tobacco is a drug),etc.. That goes with life. Have you ever stepped on an ant? That is a life form Squashed a spider,Eaten a chicken,wear leather? And to say a fetus is a life how can you eat eggs? A fetus becomes a baby the baby becomes a adult and the adult becomes the elderly. A chickens egg becomes a chicken or breakfast. Why not defend the egg? We kill animals for luxury of their skin (leather) Not to keep warm but for the look and feel only. If life is that important that we dictate it is at conception why not defend all life. Animals included.",
