      "text": "Marage is not a right, its a privage just like having a driver's licence is a privage. The reasonable person can say that we need to have a family that is compost of both sexes to create stable children. It is a fact that children without involved fathers are more likey to have problems as adults, and I would be safe to venter the same is true if they do not have active mothers. And with out a mother to play the mother role and the father to play the his role how does anyone expect our socitiy to build strong families. Normaly in such relations of homosexualty there are more or less domian roles, but not in the same method that they are in a hetreosexual family. To the child, the lines are not as ovbious, and may be confusing. Confusing children is the starting process leading them down the wrong path. For some reason, nature as desided this one for us, and we can not be what we are not, and therefor we must promote the cavepeople apoarch (Many may think I am a caveman for saying that women should be the mother and men the father, I guess I was one of the last beaver cleavers). Its even more important in todays socity where it is so easy to get sucked into trouble with just one wrong move. However (if this message is not long enough), people do have the right to fredom of assoation, so therefor this is nothing wrong with homosexual reationships, but they can not be promoted by the state, becuase the state has no betift in doing such.",
