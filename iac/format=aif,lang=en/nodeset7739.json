Apparently they have moved beyond knives and are simply using whatever tool is available to commit violent crime. They are succeeding at a rate nearly 5 times that of the US 'gun culture'.",

The same Home Office survey you linked to shows:  17% of total violent crime was 'common assault with NO injury' (i.e. pushing and shoving, spitting at someone or verbal abuse)  43% was 'common assault with less serious injury' (e.g, a scuffle outside a bar) 20% were 'harrassment - no injuries suffered. 5% were 'other violent crimes' including carrying a weapon. Only 2.1% of all violent crime led to a serious injury. The weapon most commonly used is, of course, the fist - in 78% of all cases.  In order to make this comparison make any sense we need to know how the FBI defines violent crime.",
