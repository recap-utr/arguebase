It's always interesting to me that the bible thumpers refuse to look at abortion other than through religious, save the fetus, eyes and yet, are ready to KILL the sicko's of society when they have committed a haneous crime. Too many 'thumpers' don't read all of bible. And yet the same bible states: Abortion is not murder. A fetus is not considered a human life.  If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life. -- Exodus 21:22-23 The Bible places no value on fetuses or infants less than one month old.  And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. -- Leviticus 27:6  Fetuses and infants less than one month old are not considered persons.  Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD. -- Numbers 3:15-16  God sometimes approves of killing fetuses.  And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? ... Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. -- Numbers 31:15-17 (Some of the non-virgin women must have been pregnant. They would have been killed along with their unborn fetuses.)  Your bible, not mine. Maybe Dobson needs to read a bit more of his bible rather than condeming others. Isn't he supposed to be a psychologist? What's his expertise in biblical literature? I think we all need to read a bit more before we critize how others live.",

They have NO experience with the female anatomy except what they manage to bag, they shouldn't be allowed to decide for us. They have no idea what pregnancy is like, the damage it does to our bodies and our minds, and they don't have to pay to support a child that we were forced to accept at knifepoint. Where is the logic is violating women a second time? Where's the justification for it? Doesn't the life of the unintended mother account for anything at all? Do you men have any idea of the dangerous precdent you'd be setting up with a total ban on abortion? Women who have been raped and essentially told 'You WILL have this child, you WILL carry it to term, or you WILL go to prison!' would likely commit suicide as a result, meaning that TWO lives are gonna be lost.",
