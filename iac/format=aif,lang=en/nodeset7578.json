      "text": "Lately, it's been tough for us atheists. From recent scientific discoveries that show the amazing complexities of the simplest forms of life, the subsequent mathematical improbability of random, chance, godless processes producing and maintaining life, to people like Behe, Dembski, Spetner, and many websites untainted with liberalism and political correctness of the mainstream media, the movie 'Expelled' that showed a very real probability of how we've been so close to violating the U.S. Constitution in academia. Well I have news for Christians/conservatives - they're the ones who are deluded! [insert stream of vulgar name calling here] Because God does not exist - random chance made the universe with all its order and complexity! How do I know this? From Madelyn Murray O'Hair! She said so, she proved how smart she was when she won her 'separation of church and state' lawsuit in 1963! She has garnered so many followers that also happened to have an interest in science, that they've managed to take over the scientific community! How could they be wrong? How could their current representatives, Dawkins and Harris, be wrong? They obviously know all things!  Now, who should we believe, the Bible, written and preserved over the entire period of the human ability to write, no matter how many attempts have been made to destroy it, or Dawkins and Harris and their millions of followers in the scientific community? It doesn't matter what the Bible says, Tiktaalik Roseaea is real! A small band of atheist explorers said so! We can look in telescopes and see all the galaxies we want! We know it took that light hundreds of billions of years to reach us! No God would have made the universe, and sat around that long waiting for us to be able to see it! Heh heh, is science unbelievable or what? Now, if you think we don't know how big those galaxies are, how many stars they contain, how many planets they contain that have life on them, how long it takes their light to get here (accurate to only a few hundred light years, plus or minus), you must be deluded or something! Just ask us, we'll tell you!  According to Christians, orderly , specified complexity in life and the universe show a mathematical improbability very close to impossibility of random, purposeless origins and existence of reality. That's ridiculous - all you have to do is note that someone wins the lottery just about every week despite that individuals almost impossible chances - that tells you that evolution HAD to have happened! Dawkins and Harris clearly say that God does not exist, though some deluded non-atheist scientists say that chance can't fully explain evolution, let alone the origins of life. Dawkins has dreams that spacemen came long ago and sowed the seeds of life on earth then flew away, never to be seen again! How could he be wrong - he knows all things!  It's amazing how the Bible can give us such obviously sound advise concerning finances, morality, behavior, as well as such accurate predictions about the breakdown of those things, and be so wrong about everything that science tells us about politics,and liberalism [Obama/Ried] visual here] and be so wrong about the age of the earth, or how long it takes light to reach us! I'm sure we'll find out life originated from lifeless matter someday, it's been just around the corner for 150 years now. Never mind that the corner keeps getting further and further away scientifically, we're going to find it really soon!  Look, I'm an atheist, and us atheists, we understand that things like miracles that defy the laws of physics (the origin of life by natural processes) are the truth. We know there is no God, we will never question that, because we are 100% certain that Madelyn Murray O'Hair was right! Christians aren't certain about anything - they don't know how God originated, or where he is! They have no clue about all those galaxies like we do! Clearly, stuff like morals and finances, and written history have no place in our lives in the 21st century, we must live by the words of Dawkins and Harris - soon they will be able to cure ALL diseases, make us all live forever, and count more galaxies for us! So that when there is no more death or sorrow thanks to science, and people like Dawkins, Harris, and Obama are ruling over every aspect of our lives, they'll inform me that they're correct, and they'll have ways of seeing to it that I agree with them. Are Christians ever that logical? So Christians, who exactly is the deluded one here?",

Because long ago on our planet Europe not only thought the world was flat and they could fall over at the edge into an abyss but Europe generally didn't have knowledge of the Asian cultures until the silk road was active. If the asian and european cultures were not so greatly distanced from each other history would have been greatly changed to the extent that compared to our world would be pretty loopy:p",

If you believe that a planet populated solely by atheists would remain solely atheist (without the influence of God), on what basis do you explain the many other religions that exist on Earth? Especially those that were around before Christianity, and cannot therefore be accused of copying a successful format?",

      "text": "A good question, and it's a good thing I'm not a politician (or even a talk radio host:p) or then I would have to do some dancing. I remember once when President George Bush referred to Islam as 'one of the world's great religions' - I guess a U.S. President would have to do that, as the President of a country with no establishment of religion in its foundation. A Christian without speech police can refer to Islam in a more direct way - it's a false religion.  Just about any follower of one certain religion is going to have disdain for any other religion, as well as atheism. Many atheists may think they have an advantage in that regard - they think they can group all religions together as being wrong in similar ways about their faith, and separate themselves from them. But since the term 'religion' is so broad and vague, it's easy to see that atheists can't really do that so well, because there are a few religions that they can't have much disagreement with - 'Pantheism', 'scientism', would certainly be two, and there are probably more. Any religion that worships nature, with no defined god, isn't really at odds with atheism, is it? Your phrase within parenthesis, 'without the influence of God', points out (to me) that discussions about God on these forums, and even throughout Christian study and discussion, are all too often about only his presence or absence, nothing more. There is something more, and that something is Satan, the 'great deceiver', the 'evil one'. In Databed's hypothetical, where he said 'stuck them on a planet with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ', my belief is that God/Christ would be there, (omnipresent) but I wasn't really consciously thinking about the possibility of the evil one NOT being there. I believe it's Satan's presence that causes atheism and it also causes false religions to be dreamed up.  So to clarify my answer to his question, for people on another planet 'with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ' would become a blend of atheism and false religion, since Satan is the author of both. To me as a 'fundamental' Christian, there is little difference between the two.",

That is unless God came back again, spoke his word into a book through the scribblings of random religious scholars. If you accept that this is inevitable, you are delusional.  The most likely thing would be for humans to come up with an entirely different religious doctrine. I would be willing to bet that it would pass through polytheism into monotheism as more information became available and eventually we would end up right where we are now. The problem with this scenario is that evolution would probably never be confirmed since our biological history would not be apparent. We would come up with theories that God made us and perhaps even some screwballs would say we were all part of an experiment and were placed on the planet by our ancestors a couple hundred thousand years prior.",
