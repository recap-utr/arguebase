They people who sell criminals guns do not just do it once, they do it again and again. Some of the guns used in Colombine were obtained this way. The seller knowingly sold them to minors and got less that 6 months in jail. Many times these people are not even prosecuted, will still have clean records, and will continue to buy and sell guns to 'friends'.

'Lott has been unable to provide evidence to back up his claim that 98% of defensive gun uses don't involve the firing of the weapon. When questioned Lott has changed his story several times about where he got the 98% statistic from. The validity of other statistics in his book are also in question because he didn't control for such factors as poverty and drug use. David Mustard, co-author of Lott's study, admitted under oath in Klein v. Mustard that the study left out certain variables which are relevant to the crime rate. Gary Kleck, a pro-gun advocate and researcher, commented on this '[More]likely, the declines in crime, coinciding with relaxation of carry laws were largely attributable to other factors not controlled for in the Lott and Mustard analysis'(Targeting Guns; p. 372).While the case against Lott may not be as strong as the case against Bellesiles, enough questions have been raised about Lott's book that it would be wise to refrain from relying too much on his research.' http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0226493644/ref=cm_cr_dp_2_1/103-0741513-9131040?v=glance&s=books&vi=customer-reviews",

      "text": "Keep Going: 'F. Myth #6: The Second Amendment militia is the National Guard.  The Founding Fathers made it clear that the Militia was composed of the populace at large. Both the Congress and Supreme Court have affirmed this definition of the Militia.  1. Founding Fathers * George Mason: 'I ask, who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers.'145  * Virginia Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 13 (1776): 'That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free State; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty....'  * Richard Henry Lee: 'To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them .... The mind that aims at a select militia [like the National Guard], must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle.'146  2. U.S. Congress  * The Militia Act of 1792. One year after the Second Amendment was added to the Constitution, Congress passed a law defining the militia. The Militia Act of 1792 declared that all free male citizens between the ages of 18 and 44 were to be members of the militia. Furthermore, every citizen was to be armed. The Act stated:  'Every citizen... [shall] provide himself with a good musket, or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints....'147 The Militia Act of 1792 made no provision for any type of select militia such as the National Guard.  * U.S. Senate Subcommittee Report (1982). 'In the Militia Act of 1792, the second Congress defined 'militia of the United States' to include almost every free adult male in the United States. These persons were obligated by law to possess a [military-style] firearm and a minimum supply of ammunition and military equipment.... There can be little doubt from this that when the Congress and the people spoke of the a 'militia,' they had reference to the traditional concept of the entire populace capable of bearing arms, and not to any formal group such as what is today called the National Guard.'148  * Current Federal Law: 10 U.S.C. Sec. 311. 'The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and... under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States....'149  3. Supreme Court: U.S. v. Miller (1939). In this case, the Court stated that, 'The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense... [and that] when called for service, these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.'150 '  emoticon_xkill emoticon_xkill emoticon_xkill  'The Right of the People'",
