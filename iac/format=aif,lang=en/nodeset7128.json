One can even do good science without accepting evolution, but it is difficult. For example, cosmology, astrophysics and astronomy see a very old universe. That's not compatible with young earth creationism. Geology finds an old earth, wich isn't compatible with the mythologies of sacred writings. But that is not to say that one cannot be a qualified scientist and a deist or a theist. There are lots of good Christian scientists who accept evolution.",
