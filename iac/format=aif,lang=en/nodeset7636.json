      "text": "So what you're saying is that if ID really were worthless non-science, we'd be able to tell because everyone would be happy for it to be taught alongside evolution in science class? Yeah, that makes perfect senseHopefully you can now see how far we've meandered around the disparate issues. Let's recap:1. Can looking for intelligent design be scientific?One can apply the scientific method to any study. So far, the results of that application to ID (largely through peer review) indicate that it is not logically possible to positively infer the presence of design in a biological structure.2. Is the work the ID movement has produced rigorous, and are its results significant?No. The fundamentally flawed assumption that irreducible complexity cannot be achieved by evolutionary means invalidates all derivative results, and Dembski's 'specified complexity' is neither consistent, measurable, nor meaningful. Several structures claimed to represent evidence of design have admitted to evolutionary paths (including, ironically, some of the analogies used in their literature in an attempt to illustrate things design alone can accomplish)3. Should ID be opposed as a scientific endeavour?Of course not. We only ever learn by imagining; by striking out in unexpected and even seemingly absurd directions - just so long as we're rigorous in our logic and our testing. I don't think design science would ever bear useful fruit, but I would never oppose someone pursuing it.4. Should ID as it stands be taught as an alternative to evolution in science classrooms?Absolutely not. It presently stands on a par with hypotheses about the 'electric universe', or firey comets flying out of the sun, or any number of inventive, potentially appealing, but utterly unsubstantiated notions. Its few published results have been obliterated in peer review and there's quite simply nothing there to teach.",
