      "text": "I saw Bowling for Columbine. It was excellent. It showed how many Americans have this idea that problems are solved with violence. That's the way that problems are often dealt with domestically and overseas. That's why America drops so many bombs on people in foreign nations and kills them. They interviewed some Canadians in the film and the Canadians says that they like to negotiate and work things out. That's the way they solve problems- not through violence and killing people. I think this is very relevant to the gun culture in America. Those in the gun culture tend to have the attitude that problems can be solved with violence- thus the necessity of owning an instrument of death and destruction. I remember that Michael Moore went into the house of one gun owner and the gun owner showed him the loaded gun that he slept with under his pillow. I think that's dangerous and totally stupid to sleep with a gun under your pillow. The film also examined famous people from the gun culture like Terry Nichols and Timothy McVeigh. Moore also accomplished some good things. He went to K-mart with some victims of Columbine and convinced K-mart to stop selling handgun ammunition.",

      "text": "I agree. I wouldn't have minded Bowling so much if he had either made a documentary or made a commercial film. In the end, the message wasn't that bad. For all intenst and purposes he said exactly what the pr-gunners have been saying for years, which is that guns don't kill, people kill.  Now, he took a kind of roundabout means of getting there, but that was more or less the conclusion of the film. Our society is a messed up place and people are scared. I am not sure that he is right that they have no reason to be (just look at our crime statistics). Watching the film, it almost looks like he set out to make one movie then ended up making another. The first 2/3 of the film certainly seemed like the message was 'guns are evil'. It wasn't until the end that you come to the revelation that his message is not 'guns are evil'.  The sensationalist methods he used in the film, IMHO, pretty much strike it from the 'documentary' list.",
