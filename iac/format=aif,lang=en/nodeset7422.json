If you (or anyone else) cares to, you will be able to watch as I edit and construct my argument. It may be lengthy so keep it in mind that if I have to divide it up, and you post in the interim, I will have to delete this first half and move it to the end. By the way,... other than working some things out in my head,... I don't have anything prepared to post. This will be a work in progress. ... this will take quite a while. (Maybe days) I see you are watching, and don't want you thinking this will be developing quickly. I will let you know when I've concluded. --Chuz *** Note to Ian. In my attempt to compile my 'summary' I have realized that I never actually completed my arguments. It's kind of hard to summarize that which hasn't already been presented. So, my sumarization if you will- will now consists of two parts. First my arguments and then my summary.

      "text": "Chuz, the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point. Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument? There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail.",

You challenged me to produce an argument, so I'm going to produce my argument. I will then summarize the argument, and you can respond to it and we can then discuss / debate those specifics that you have a problem with. Truthfully, this is how I should have first responded to your challenge.  Doing it piece meal has only resulted in a less focused debate. --Chuz",
