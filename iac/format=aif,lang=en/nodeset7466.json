It happened in New Orleans during catrina, the only difference is what Happened in New Orleans never went nationwide as it will if Obama is elected. The NRA called Obama up and invited him to go on a bear hunt, Obama agreed to go but said he wanted nothing to do with a gun though, Obama said he would only be an observer of the bear being hunted. The NRA then asked Obama if he went unarmed and found himself face to face with an angry bear how he would handle the situation, Obama replied' I will enter into direct peace negotiations with the bear, if that fails I will place sanctions on him. People who support obama are like sheep being led to slaughter. You better wake up and do the background research on Obama before you make the biggest mistake of your life by voting for that idiot. You can view the New Orleans gun confiscation video on you tube or the NRA web-site either one.",
