There are, I am sure, many good families that have raised criminals. One of the things that mark maturity is not blaming your parents for your downfalls. So are you saying that a person that is unloved in their youth would have been better off not having a shot at life?  If you are please consider: My Mom and Dad had the abortion appointment set up. That's how unwanted I was. Do you think I don't have a right to life? That I was better served not being able to give life a go? My sister was divorced (for lack of a better word) from her parents, are you saying because they treated her poor she was better off not being? A lousy beginning in life does not mean that a person's whole life will be worthless or unhappy. have a nice day, heidi",
