Put another way, can anyone explain why it is constitutional to execute a person who was 18 years old when they committed the crime, but it is unconstitutional to execute a person who was under 18 when they committed the crime? Participants in this discussion should assume that the death penalty, in general, is constitutional. This has been the case from the beginning of our Republic, and has been reaffirmed multiple times. In other words, it is not an appropriate argument to try and argue that the death penalty, in general, is unconstitutional. That has neither been the case through our history, and is not the current state of the law. *Note: I am speaking within the context of the United States, and its Constitution.",

      "text": "I think many things are getting confused here. First, I have no idea what 'moral maturity' means. You talk as though that is some definable entity. Next, one may reasonably consider that children are cognitively different from adults. Despite what society or 5 judges have to say, that seems to me a valid reason for applying different sentences to different people. The question was raised with respect to the death penalty as well. We are not talking about criteria for guilt, but once convicted, we are talking about whether to execute a person or not. Unless you feel that punishment should be based solely on retribution, I think there is some wiggle room for different sentencing guidelines for different aged humans.  You have conceded that a difference in neurophysiologic fitness makes sense, but we should decide on a case by case basis. If you can figure out a reliable way to do that, go for it.  We draw the line based upon age all the time for all sorts of things. The issue of abortion is different for many reasons. We are not deciding on whether to execute a person based upon a crime they committed. That makes it a different issue. Ideally, we would never have a pregnant young woman under the age of 18 make a decision like that without the support and guidance of her loving parents. The ideal situation sometimes does not exist. An underage female may legally make this decision precisely because there are many out there who do not have that guidance at all or informing parents would make things worse. It just so happens that females are fertile prior to 18, so we do not have the luxury of applying similar age requirements. If you could ban pregnancy prior to 18, now you'd be talking.",
