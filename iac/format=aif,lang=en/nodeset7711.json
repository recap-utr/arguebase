Wade and criticized it for its lack of adherence to conservative methodology: 'Heller represents a triumph for conservative lawyers.

In fact, Heller encourages Americans to do what conservative jurists warned for years they should not do: bypass the ballot and seek to press their political agenda in the courts.'

When we brought the Heller case before the Supreme Court, we wanted them to determine whether or not DC's handgun laws, which weren't voted on but rather just passed without debate, were constitutional or not. That's the job of the Supreme Court, to determine if a law is unconstitutional or if it may be allowed to remain as law. Your standard of pressing legislators to pass one law to repeal another is just plain stupid. The only ones who we could ask to do such are the DC people who threw their full support behind the DC gun ban, proclaiming that it was both constitutional and reasonable, and should be allowed to remain. There was absolutely no way of using the ballot to get anything done. And another thing. There's absolutely no political agenda here, whatsoever.

      "text": "Is there a point here? Didn't the dissenting Justices all agree that the right is an individual right, claimable and enforceable by individuals? It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it. In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe's 'prenumbra' theory, that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others. I endorse Justice Harlan's dissent in Poe without Stevens' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation, since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred: 'Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 9. As the second Justice Harlan recognized: '[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This `liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.'' Casey v. Planned Parenthood, 505 U.S. 833, 848 (1992) This famous exposition is a long standing favorite of Stevens. He cited it in his dissent in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 306-07 (1994). But he abandons his relationship with these ideals in Heller? Give me a break . . . Who's sacrificing his principles for policy? At least Scalia's error results in an outcome that is consistent with his fundamental beliefs. That can not be said for Stevens. Just for info sake, Harlan's dissent is also quoted in the plurality (Stevens concurring) in Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 502 (1977) , it was originally written by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 543 (1961)",

      "text": "MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATES Now consider a different, somewhat special meaning of the word 'carry'-a meaning upon which the linguistic arguments of petitioners and the dissent must rest. The Oxford English Dictionary's twenty-sixth definition of 'carry' is 'bear, wear, hold up, or sustain, as one moves about; habitually to bear about with one.' 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 921. Webster's defines 'carry' as 'to move while supporting,' not just in a vehicle, but also 'in one's hands or arms.' Webster's Third New International Dictionary, supra, at 343. And Black's Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase 'carry arms or weapons' as 'To wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with another person.' Black's Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990). These special definitions, however, do not purport to limit the 'carrying of arms' to the circumstances they describe. No one doubts that one who bears arms on his person 'carries a weapon.' But to say that is not to deny that one may also 'carry a weapon' tied to the saddle of a horse or placed in a bag in a car. Nor is there any linguistic reason to think that Congress intended to limit the word 'carries' in the statute to any of these special definitions. To the contrary, all these special definitions embody a form of an important, but secondary, meaning of 'carry,' a meaning that suggests support rather than movement or transportation, as when, for example, a column 'carries' the weight of an arch. 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 919, 921.",

Heller was not about concealed carry, but rather the RKBA for self defense Of the 3 judges, only Dickensen interpreted the RKBA as did the dissents in Heller.

Conservative opposition to Roe and abortion rights in general belie their supposed allegiance to the concept of a government with strictly limited powers -- for saying that a unenumerated right does not exist where no power is conferred to act in that arena is stating that no limits on government's power exist . . . That government power shall fill the void, not liberty. Scalia's error in Heller was trying to explain the 2nd as a historical entity instead of explaining SCOTUS's application of the Amendment in prior cases. Heller neither stated or established anything new; there never was a 'state' or 'collective' right aspect to the 2nd . . . It was always interpreted by SCOTUS to be an individual right exercisable, claimable and enforceable by individuals separately from any militia connection. I just wish Scalia had restated and relied on SCOTUS's prior holdings that the right is not created, granted or otherwise established by the Amendment so the right is not dependent in any manner upon the words of the Amendment . . . Why he engaged in the linguistic analysis I'll never know or understand.   Is there a point here? Didn't the dissenting Justices all agree that the right is an individual right, claimable and enforceable by individuals? It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it. In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe's 'prenumbra' theory, that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others. I endorse Justice Harlan's dissent in Poe without Stevens' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation, since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred: 'Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects.

Casey v. Planned Parenthood, 505 U.S. 833, 848 (1992) This famous exposition is a long standing favorite of Stevens. He cited it in his dissent in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 306-07 (1994).

At least Scalia's error results in an outcome that is consistent with his fundamental beliefs. That can not be said for Stevens. Just for info sake, Harlan's dissent is also quoted in the plurality (Stevens concurring) in Moore v.

Weisman, 505 U.S. 577 (1992); if, as I say, our pronouncement of constitutional law rests primarily on value judgments, then a free and intelligent people's attitude towards us can be expected to be (ought to be) quite different. The people know that their value judgments are quite as good as those taught in any law school -- maybe better. If, indeed, the 'liberties' protected by the Constitution are, as the Court says, undefined and unbounded, then the people should demonstrate, to protest that we do not implement their values instead of ours.'Arguably, the language of the Second Amendment is ambiguous.

However, the text of the Constitution has as much to say about such restrictions as it does about abortion.

But if a prologue can be used only to clarify an ambiguous operative provision, surely the first step must be to determine whether the operative provision is ambiguous. It might be argued, we suppose, that the prologue itself should be one of the factors that go into the determination of whether the operative provision is ambiguous&#8212;but that would cause the prologue to be used to produce ambiguity rather than just to resolve it. In any event, even if we considered the prologue along with the operative provision we would reach the same result we do today, since (as we explain) our interpretation of &#8220;the right of the people to keep and bear arms&#8221; furthers the purpose of an effective militia no less than (indeed, more than) the dissent&#8217;s interpretation. See infra, at 26&#8211;27. 5 JUSTICE STEVENS is of course correct, post, at 10, that the right to assemble cannot be exercised alone, but it is still an individual right, and not one conditioned upon membership in some defined &#8220;assembly,&#8221; as he contends the right to bear arms is conditioned upon membership in a defined militia. And JUSTICE STEVENS is dead wrong to think that the right to petition is &#8220;primarily collective in nature.&#8221; Ibid. See McDonald v. Smith, 472 U.
