And if that is murder, how can one argue that intervening with a developing baby is not murder? To me there is no distinction between the two. Once fertilization has occured, we have a responsibility to do everything in our power to nourish the developement of that child.",

Making blanket statements such as yours ignores reality. Is it murder to save the life of the mother at the fetus' expense? This question of course ignores that murder can only occur if it is an illegal killing.",
