      "text": "Famous British evolutionary anthropologist and anatomist, Sir Arthur Keith, is quoted as saying, 'Evolution is unproved and unprovable. We believe it only because the alternative is Special Creation, and that is unthinkable.' However, this is not acceptable under general principles of science. Unless a natural mechanism constrained by Natural Law, by which the entire universe could come into existence and further develop through random process, is found, a Creator must be the theoretical default. It doesn't matter whether an individual scientist has difficulty accepting it or not. As Sir Arthur Conan Doyle so eloquently stated in his Sherlock Holmes series, 'Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.'",

      "text": "Lack of a Natural Mechanism. Charles Darwin, in his Origin of Species, proposed Natural Selection to be the mechanism by which an original simple-celled organism could have evolved gradually into all species observed today, both plant and animal. Darwin defines evolution as 'descent with modification.' However, Natural Selection is known to be a conservative process, not a means of developing complexity from simplicity. Later, with our increased understanding of genetics, it was thought perhaps Natural Selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor. However, this is theoretical and controversial, since 'beneficial' mutations have yet to be observed. In fact, scientists have only observed harmful, 'downward' mutations thus far. Time Constraints. Both Creationists and Evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible, there needs to be an excessive (if not infinite) amount of time. For much of the 20th century, it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed. If the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred, the age was pushed back in the textbooks. In 1905, the earth was declared to be two billion years old. By 1970, the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old, and by the 1990's, the earth had become 4.6 billion years old. However, Young Earth advocates have identified quite a few Young Earth chronometers in recent years. Currently, there are approximately five times more natural chronometers indicating a 'Young Earth' than an 'Old Earth.' Each discovery is a separate 'Limiting Factor' that places a constraint on the possible age of the earth. For example, moon drift, earth rotation speed, magnetic field decay, erosion rates, chemical influx into the oceans, ocean salinity, etc, all constrain the possible age of the earth. Each Limiting Factor is distinct. If one were successfully challenged, there is still the problem of all the rest. Furthermore, there are Limiting Factors constraining the possible age of the universe, such as spiral galaxies where they're maintaining their spiral shapes despite their centers spinning faster than their extremities.",

And since then, scientists have been able to evolve in the lab a ribozyme that is capable of copying part of its own sequence.

      "text": "\u00c2\u201dWell, the first popular technique of creationists is to try to find examples of bad radiometric dates and offer these up as proof that radiometric dating is totally unreliable. Henry Morris, in his 1974 book 'Scientific Creationism' made the claim that K/Ar dates for lava from the 1801 Hulalalei volcano lava flow ranged from 160 million years to 3 billion years old. With results like these, radiometric dating must be totally useless - how could scientists possibly be so stupid as to believe that radiometric dating could be of any merit when a simple lava flow gives such a wide range of dates - right in their own research? As usual with such claims, we'll have to dig a little further to get at the truth. Morris cited a study by Funkhouser and Norton \u00c2\u2013 'Radiogenic Helium and Argon in Ultramafic Inclusions from Hawaii' published in the Journal of Geophysics Research, vol. 73, pgs. 4601 - 4607. What Morris didn't bother to inform his readers was that the study concerned xenoliths - fragments of foreign rock broken off by the magmas intrusion through the crust. Since they are not completely melted by the magma, they are in fact much older than the lava flow (with K/Ar dating, what you are really dating is how long it has been since the rock solidified from the molten state - at this point the daughter Argon can no longer escape from the rock). That particular study confirmed (as geologists already suspected) that xenoliths could not be properly dated with the K/Ar method. The Funkhouser and Norton study clearly stated that the 'ages' determined by K/Ar dating had no geological meaning and also determined that the xenoliths contained excess argon trapped in 'air' bubbles inside the rock. Of course there was no mention of these details by Morris or any of the internet postings I have seen that still list this 'problem' - despite the fact that Dalrymple answered it over 10 years ago. In the same paper, Dalrymple goes on to describe in detail several other quotes taken out of context by Creationists.\u00c2\u201d (http://www.gate.net/~rwms/AgeEarth.html)",

      "text": "So the radiometric data stand: the Earth, moon, and older meteorites are all 4 or so billion years old, not just a few thousand.Changing Decay Rates?Another Creationist attempt to counter radiometric dates that are incompatible with their young-Earth religious position is to claim that decay rates are not constant, thereby throwing a monkey wrench into the calculations. There are at least two problems with this argument.First, it is not at all clear how varying decay rates could result in multiple decay sequences all agreeing on the age of an object. Remember, for example, the oldest exposed rocks on earth, dated using different parent radioisotopes? All five of the decay sequences (Rb-Sr, Pb-Pb, U-Pb, Th-Pb, and Lu-Hf) clustered right around 3.7 billion years. If decay rates vary enough to throw off dates by billions of years, why would they vary in exactly the way needed to consistently produce the same results?Second, radioactive decay of nuclei is not comparable to chemical reactions. In chemistry, the rate at which chemical reaction proceeds can be altered in a number of ways, such as by changing the temperature, acidity, pressure, or reactant concentrations. Such changes, however, have essentially no effect on nuclear decay. In fact, experimental attempts to alter decay rates have been made, but failed.",
