'99.9%' of learned people around Columbus' time knew the world was a sphere and had done so for 2,000 years at least! The idea that people thought the world flat at the time is a myth. Try: http://nabataea.net/flatearth.html http://www.bede.org.uk/flatearth.htm http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c034.html They are from a variety of sources, even including a creationist one at the end. Oh and no surprise that the very first line of that last site is a lie, as that is standard practice of creation websites. 'Evolutionists often falsely accuse creationists of believing in a flat Earth' is untrue: we simply liken them to flat-Earthers because of the same assinine refusal to accept reality.",
