We cannot serve in the military because of our sexual orientation.  We do not all have protections against being fired because of our sexual orientation. As for the secular rights, I don't think this is right. From a religious standpoint, I've never seen more ignorance, hatred or twisted lies put into words as I have on this board from some of the folks who are Christians. Personally, I don't see the difference between what is 'good' and what is 'evil' when it comes to religion on here. I've seen satanists say nicer things than what has been written here. If this is your idea of what is good, I want no part of it. As far as the two, secular rights and religious rights, it seems that although the constitution has a freedom of religion clause in it, faith based people cannot and will not separate the two out making the separation clause invalid...what's the point in that?",

Since it's no longer PC To attack African-Americans for their obvious differences, it's not PC to go after other religions (especially Judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go. I mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong. Even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around HETEROSEXUAL sex, they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them. Insted, they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights. It's easier that way.",
