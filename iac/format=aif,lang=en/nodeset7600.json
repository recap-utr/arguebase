You supplied that because it is foolish to claim otherwise. That's what I mean when I say that you reject parts of the Bible that you see as foolish. When you have accepted the evidence that the Bible is in error (4 legs on a grasshopper, sun at center of solar system, rabbits chewing cud, an unmoving earth) you add elements that aren't in the Bible and declare it without error. You 'interpret' and then claim that you are reading it literally. Pick one and go with it.
