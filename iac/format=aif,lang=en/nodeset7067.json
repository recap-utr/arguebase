Additionally, supersnort doesn't seem to be aware that all of our domestic animals were produced by inbreeding. That's why they are called 'pure breed' or 'thoroughbred'.

When Europeans first got to Hawaii they found that the royal family was easily recognized because they were taller and more robust than other Hawaiians.
