It is to encourage the lawmakers to vote against it. The lawmakers have not yet agreed to vote it down. Knowing the State of Illinois, I am predicting they will pay no attention to the commoners.  The only thing a glean out of this is that the common people have more sense than the lawmakers. But I've actually known that for a long time.",
