      "text": "Actually, the title is a little deceptive, however I have noticed that one verse in his new song 'Runaway Love', one of the verses brings up something relevant on the abortion debate. Verse 3 goes of the song, I noticed goes: 'Little Erica is eleven years old She's steady trying to figure why the world is so cold So she pops x to get rid of all the pain 'Cause she's having sex with a boy who's sixteen Emotions run deep and she thinks she's in love So there's no protection he's using no glove Never thinking 'bout the consequences of her actions Living for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction The days go by and her belly gets big The father bails out he ain't ready for a kid Knowing her mama will blow it all outta proportion Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion Erica is stuck up in the world on her own Forced to think that hell is a place called home Nothing else to do but get her clothes and pack She say she's about to run away and never come back.'  I know its not completely relevant to the abortion issue, but it is very relevant to the lives of little girls living in poverty and being abused. I would like to know what your opinion of the verse is.",

It is like being in space and bouncing around, especially when mum is running up and down. But it is all cut short one bad day, a bladed catheter sliced me away. First it ripped and severed my leg, then it punctured my guts, removed them today. The jabbing and slicing makes me feel bad, I wonder why mummy is making me sad? I never got the chance to see her face, now I'm dismembered all over the place. I will never know her or see her, not a trace, I have been removed from the human race. Want to cuddle and give her a kiss, and say hi to my brothers I know I will miss.",
