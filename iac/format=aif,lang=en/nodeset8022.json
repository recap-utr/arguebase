The only way to do this is to never follow any point through to it's ultimate conclusion, as it will be shown as false. Instead, the best tactic is to attempt to bury opponents under an ever-shifting, ever-repeating argument in an attempt to persuade them that because you have so many arguments, you must be right - and because you never stay on-topic, none of your points are ever completely wiped of the map, so you can revisit them and force them to be debated from the start again. This is why the Index to Creationist Claims is so handy, because it allows most arguments to be wiped out from stage one. Hence my personal Creationist Challenge - if someone can come up with an argument for creationism that I cannot answer with a single link to the Index, I will take that person seriously. But yes, the above could apply to anyone who is 'blatantly wrong' (to put it tactlessly).",

You are talking to a person who accepts Intelligent Design as a rational explanation for Mans origin, yet you are so ill informed that you allege he is aligned with a belief in animism, when animism was founded in pagan religions and asserts that pretty much everything has a soul and spirit. Animism (from Latin anima (soul, life)[1][2]) commonly refers to a religious belief that souls or spirits exist in animals, plants and other entities, in addition to humans.[3] Animism may also attribute souls to natural phenomena, geographic features, and even manufactured objects. Religions which emphasize animism in this sense include Shinto, Hinduism and pagan faiths such as folk religions and Neopaganism.Animism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Now show me a christian who defends ID, believes that, you mental midget. emoticon_xdonno",
