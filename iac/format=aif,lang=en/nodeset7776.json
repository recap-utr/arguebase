This says different: http://skepdic.com/homeo.html I do know of recent studies that show that minute amounts of toxic substances are beneficial and therapeutic. I don't know if one can consider this homeopathic medicine though. I guess I don't know what's being called homeopathic medicine these days. If someone comes up with something that works can they just call it homeopathic medicine and say that homeopathic medicine works?",

And I think homeopathic medicine is all about using things like vitamin c to prevent colds, and making sure you ingest lots of calcium if you are worried about ostioperosis.
