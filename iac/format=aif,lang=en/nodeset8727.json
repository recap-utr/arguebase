In my opinion, you and your ilk are as dangerous a threat to America as the terrorists who have openly vowed to destroy us.",

Right on their front page they say 'The bill, H.R. 6691, would allow nearly anyone, even teenagers and children, to carry loaded assault rifles on the streets of our Nation's Capital' but the text of the bill says no such thing. There's no talk of lowering the age for gun ownership below 18, which is already federal law, there's no talk of opening up sales of fully-automatic machineguns capable of firing 1,200 rounds per minute, there's no talk of the bill opening up sales of .50 caliber rifles that can hit a target at over a mile, there's nothing. All this bill is gonna do is force DC to be in line with the rest of America. How exactly is that a bad thing, and why shouldn't we support it?",
