If marriage is a legal right, it must be allowed to all couples. If you do not agree with this, then it must be removed as a legal right and replaced entirely with civil unions. Sugar and sweetner will never be the same thing, and it is an evil action to take all the sugar for oneself then to refuse it to others, telling them that they can make due with the artificial stuff. It's not the composition of the sugar I want redefined; it is who is allowed to use it. Changing the composition of sugar would affect other people who want to use it, and it would require people to put forth additional effort for my sake alone. Allowing a same-sex couple to get married does nothing but allow everyone access to that which already exists. I do not want to make special laws just for myself; I believe that the opponents of same-sex marriage are the ones who seek to do that. I want to give everyone equal access to the existing rights today, equal access to the sugar. There is enough to go around.",
