Maybe you can postulate a god as the prime mover of the big bang, I don't know why you'd want to, but i suppose you could. After that, the laws of physics take over, and evolution is the result. Even if one were to suppose a god initiated the big bang, there is no reason to suppose it took an interest in subsequent events, or nudged them down one path as opposed to any other. Evolution doesn't need a deity in its daily operation... that's why it works so well as science!",
