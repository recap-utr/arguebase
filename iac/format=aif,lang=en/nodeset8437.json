If I slept with my girlfriend and she turned up pregnant, and she wanted to abort, but I want my child to raise and love, I have virtually no legal say in it. This is wrong no matter how you look at it, and yes, I do oppose abortions. Laws should be passed where the abortion can only be performed without the fathers ok if it endangers the life of the mother.",

If a man impregnates a woman, if he doesn't want to take responsibility for his impregnation of that woman, all he has to do is walk. That's how a man does abortion -- all the time. It is very difficult to legally get a father to take responsibility for children he has fathered.  As a matter of fact, there are a number of really ugly customers in men, a great number of extremely hateful men:",
