Midyear shooting deaths fell from 38 in 2007 to 21 this year, the lowest number since 1960, when 18 officers were killed by gunfire. 'I'm amazed to see declines of this magnitude,' says Craig Floyd, memorial fund chairman. 'We were questioning last year whether 2007 was the start of a troubling trend. Now, I'm hoping that 2007 was an aberration.' http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-07-09-police-deaths_N.htm",

But what is crazy in my opinion, is admitting that there are holes in the system that allow criminals to get automatic weapons illegally, and you see the solution as banning automatic weapons from being purchased by law abiding citizens rather than screaming for the holes in the system to be fixed so the criminals can't get them. It seems to me that you have an anti-gun agenda and will use any flaw in the system as an excuse to ban all guns for all people. Is that a fair assessment of where you stand?",
