      "text": "Ok. So Lott is flakey. Then Bellesiles is OK? Riiiiight. I though a person's reputation stood on thier own behavior and achivements, not based on someone else. Besides the debate weather Lott is dishonest or not is debatable and still going on. The debate weather Bellesiles is dishonest is over, he is most definately a liar, and this was decided by his boss and the Banqcroft prize commitee.",

      "text": "Lott, on the other hand, apparently lost a single footnot about how often guns just had to be brandishged in order to scare off an attacker. His other research has not been brought into question. The portion that WAS brought into question was removed from the research (yep, that single sentence was deleted). It was not at all pivitol to the research, it was just a sidebar he found interesting.  With lott, the question was 'can you prove this one sentence'. with Bellesiles, the question was 'can you show me a single page in this book that does not contain an instance of academic fraud?' With lott, the figure apparently came from a phone poll he conducted himself, which he claims was lost in a hard drive crash. There have been people who came forward that remember taking the poll. Without actual tables of results, he has withdrawn the ascertation. In Ballesiles case, his missing date was show to have been lost over 100 years before he was born, and he has refused to withdraw his claims.  You really don't see the difference between these guys?",
