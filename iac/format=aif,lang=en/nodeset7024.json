The craters on the moon give us information about past impacts, do we demand that information has a 'sender'? Spectroscopy gives us information about the constitution of stars, do we demand that information has a 'sender'? And indeed even if we use the argument that all 'information' has a sender and recipient, genetic material has...neither. It's just chemicals and forces. Nothing more. There is no identifiable 'sender', and there is no identifiable 'recipient'. Sure, you can chuck a god in here or there if you like, but that's not where the evidence leads. DNA is not a code, DNA is certainly not a 'language', and it only falls under the definition of 'information' that pretty much everything we decide to look at does.",
