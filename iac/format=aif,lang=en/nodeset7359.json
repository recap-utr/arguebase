      "text": "Sharron Angle may be giving the press the silent treatment now, but she hasn't always been so tight-lipped. Think Progress (via Alternet) has dug up some eyebrow-raising audio of a radio interview the Nevada Senate candidate did with Bill Manders back in January. The subject: abortion. Her stance: disgusting. Manders asks her whether there is 'any reason at all for an abortion,' and she answers: 'Not in my book.' For clarity, he says: 'So, in other words, rape and incest would not be something?' And Angle replies with this reasoning: 'You know, I'm a Christian, and I believe that God has a plan and a purpose for each one of our lives and that he can intercede in all kinds of situations and we need to have a little faith in many things.' You see, God planned your rape and pregnancy. Isn't that reassuring?",
