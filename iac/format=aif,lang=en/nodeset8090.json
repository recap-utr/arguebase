As for the labels, I don't care either way...you want to call me 'anti-choice' so be it. I am anti-choice. I don't think you should have to choice to kill someone else. The ones that bug be are 'anti-woman' or something like that. I don't understand how saying everyone is worthy of living degrades someone...the only way this is possible is if you assume woman were above everyone else to begin with...in that case, I do agree you should degrade.",
