According to authorities, Schneider told the youths to vacate his property, but they began assaulting him, even slamming the truck door on his head. Schneider, who has a concealed carry permit, reached for his .4o pistol and fired twice at his assailants. 'I thought they were going to kill me if I didn't do something,' Schneider said. Two suspects fled, one of them wounded, while a third collapsed. Schneider says he prayed for the fallen suspect to survive, but he died at the scene",
