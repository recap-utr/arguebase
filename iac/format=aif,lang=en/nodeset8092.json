Many of the holes have been closed even in my lifetime and the creationist god-of-the-gaps is being reduced to smaller and smaller gaps. But if you want a creationist to 'join the real world', you're going to have to do more than be offensive and insulting. You might present some actual facts to support your position. Of course, I presume that you will actually educate yourself before presenting the facts. Have a nice day.",
