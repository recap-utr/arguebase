      "text": "True - most abortions are not due serious health/life risks - and there is much room for debate as to what other situations are valid enough to warrant abortion or could be addressed in other ways (my favorite method of decreasing abortion). However, the claim that all other abortions are carried out because women are partying or vain is vile, insulting, false and one of the worst examples of misogyny I have seen in a long, long while. (Pity whatever fool of a woman ends up or ended up with you.) Granted - this is typical of a lifer who really cares not a whit about women or children - only in maintaining their supposed moral superiority. There are lots of reasons women abort - you can help by trying to address them or you can generalize, trivialize and insult. One will actually help the women and potentially her baby - the other allows you to pat yourself on the back.",
