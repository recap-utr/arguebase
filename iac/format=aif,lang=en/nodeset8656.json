This is merely a snapshot of the kind of detailed information about tens of thousands of smuggled guns that the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives has in its files but no longer releases to the public or our elected representatives on Capitol Hill.&#8221; VPC - Press Release - (04/15/2009) - Mexican Gun Traffickers Easily Obtain Military-Style Weapons from U.S. Civilian Gun Market, New Analysis of Federal Criminal Court Records Confirms its obvious America needs alot more gun control if mexican criminals have no problem buying things like cop killer handguns and 50 caliber and assault weapons in US gun shops!",

What is interesting is how many laws were broken to buy and get the weapons back into Mexico. Sounds like a problem with lax enforcement.  PS what exactly are 'cop killer handguns' beyond an attempt to get the unknowing public aroused and enraged. The self same bunch of loons touted 'cop killer' bullets and Hollywierd even jumped on the bandwagon with a movie. The only fly in the ointment was they couldn't trot out a single case when a LEO died from bullets penetrating the vest.",
