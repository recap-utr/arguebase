Under certain conditions bacteria might copy and pass specific genes on to other bacteria which incorporate them into their genetic makeup, a process known as conjugation or horizontal gene transfer.  Biologists, despite the evidence, have refused to acknowledge that we are all wholes - they see us only as an accumulation of parts.",
