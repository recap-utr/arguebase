What was the Designer supposed to have actually done, and when? I mean, did he create the first single celled creatures from scratch and dump them in the ocean billions of years ago, or did he just nudge some chemicals towards each other? Did he cause specific mutations in certain animals at some point to get a desired result? Or did he build animals from scratch, fully formed? I can't find any answers to these questions anywhere.",

      "text": "May I attempt to respond as an IDist would respond? 1) If God-- err, the designer can pop IC systems into existence at will, don't you think He.../she/it can do so any way he/she/it damn well pleases? See also answer 2. 2) IDists need no mechanistic explanation. The idea that evidence for design means design stands by itself. (Nevermind that the crux of ID is that it demands an evolutionary mechanism for the appearance of alleged IC/'unevolvable' systems; the ID philosophy totally sidesteps that requirement.) 3) Again, the validity of ID depends not on the designer's choices but only on the designer interacting at all. 4) OEC/IDists will claim that environmental conditions have changed over millions of years just like mainstream science says they have; after all, some IDists 'don't doubt' mechanisms such as natural selection. For the obvious problem of the designer 'letting' species go extinct, see answer 3. I'm guessing that YEC/IDists will just point to the flood. And the conspiracy theorist/IDists will blame Satan for trying to mislead people. 5) Not a single one. (Either that answer, or maybe 'Well, uh, hasn't Behe done something by now?', which still means none.)  So there you have it. An evolutionist's formulation of an IDists response. Appropriately, because ID as a whole is essentially an argument from ignorance, ignorance plays a role the answers to all your questions. ('Don't know'/'Don't care'/'Doesn't matter.') ID simply sidesteps these issues. Also notice that none of the statements are testable or falsifiable, except for the parts of the OEC view that are perfectly compatible with geology and evolution. Some will claim that they 'have no reason' to doubt common descent (a la Behe) but do a conspicuously good job of not saying they actually believe it. And if any IDists have a problem with my responses, they're able to post their own responses. However, they were able to do that even before I responded, and they didn't...",
