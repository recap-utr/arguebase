This is a great story from QLD my neck of the woods Four to stand trial on murder charges | Australia Crime | Robberies, Assaults and Convictions in Australia | Finda This was just shown on ACA with the brothers and wife telling their untold story What they did not tell you is that both brothers were torchered for hours.  What is the best part of this story though? Once they phoned the police saying their dad had just been shot and was dead and the men were coming after them it took the police 9 HOURS TO RESPOND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  9 HOURS, Not minutes HOURS! But since these victoms were not allowed to own a gun to protect themselves they were actually much safer!",
