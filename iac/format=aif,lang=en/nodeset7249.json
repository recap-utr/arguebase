Evidently, each one of them at some point posted something deemed worthy to have them banned by the forum moderators according to the subjective rules of the forum.  Their presence is missed. I figured this would be the one forum that would most likely catch their attention, should they be perusing through. Without the strong presence of a resident biologist, my opinion is that this forum has limited opportunities to learn new and interesting information about evolution. Such information can help individuals see evolution as reasonable instead of perceiving it as something evil that is devoid of God, or put in their minds by the devil, etc. If the moderators feel that this is not an appropriate post for this forum, then they have to make the call to delete it.
