If for example I tell you that there exists a network and that communication takes place over it can you tell me if that indicates intelligence or not? And how do you propose to PROVE that only living things CAN be intelligent? What evidence would suffice? Clearly according to you communication over a network is NOT sufficient proof! What you have in fact done is to claim that all living things are intelligent and that communication is not evidence of that intelligence. So if communication is not adequate to demonstrate intelligence what criterion do you use? Frankly I think you have no criterion in mind other than a system being what you call alive - itself a vague and difficult to pin down category! Are viruses intelligent or not?",
