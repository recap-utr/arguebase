      "text": "[I](Before reading this, please know that I make no value judgements on abortion. From my perspective, it is not right or wrong or good or bad... It is what it is, regardless of how it is perceived or labeled. If you think it's acceptable as the 'right to choose' -- good for you! If you abhor it as 'murdering innocent children' -- good for you! I am posting this information because it is something that I discovered recently while investigating various methods of birth control... And I believe that many people are not aware of the information I communicate here. I wasn't. Take it for whatever it's worth. If the issue is important to you for any reason, I encourage you to do some research on the subject.) The answer depends on the definition of 'abortion.' According to currently accepted medical terms, 'pregnancy' does not begin until the point of implantation of the embryo in the uterine wall. And 'abortion' is the termination of a pregnancy. So, according to the currently accepted medical terminology, the answer is no, of course not! However, if you define 'abortion' as the termination of a physical entity that has been developing since the point of fertilization, then there is significant evidence to suggest that the answer is yes. And absolutely no evidence to suggest that the answer is no. The birth control pill has three primary functions (as do most hormonal bc agents): 1. The primary function of the pill is to prevent ovulation, but sometimes ovulation occurs while on the pill. 2. A secondary function of the pill is to slow sperm down so that they do not reach the ovum in order to fertilize it, but sometimes the sperm does reach the ovum in time to fertilize it. 3. The third function of birth control pills is to create a less hospitable environment for a fertilized egg to implant in the uterus, but sometimes the fertilized egg does implant in the uterine wall, as evidenced by a 'failure rate' when women are on the pill. (In other words, sometimes women get pregnant while on the pill, indicating that all three functions of the pill failed.) It is widely recognized by pill manufacturers and within the medical/scientific community that the effects of the pill can and sometimes do arrest the development of a human embryo that has not yet implanted itself into the uterine wall by 'creating a less hospitable environment for the embryo.' How often this happens is uncertain (some estimates are as high as 50% while some estimates suggest percentages in the low single digits), but there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that it can and does happen. Your physician may or may not be aware of this. Ask her/him if you are concerned. Your physician also may assert that birth control pills do not cause 'abortions' because according to accepted medical terminology, pregnancy doesn't begin until implantation. While I do not personally believe abortion is 'wrong,' some people DO believe it is wrong. If you do believe that abortion (as in terminating the development of an entity after conception) then you may logically also have to believe that using the pill for birth control is wrong as it may lead to an abortion prior to implantation. Hope this is helpful information! The Bootfitter",

      "text": "I know that sometimes when a woman is on the pill, and they happen to get pregnant anyways, it will cause you to miscarry (not always, but sometimes). Usually it happens very early in the pregnancy before they realize they are even pregnant. But I don't know if I would call that abortion as in the way the term is normally used, because the woman isn't terminating the pregnancy on purpose, although miscarriage is called 'spontanious abortion'.. I also remember hearing from a friend of mine, who is Catholic, that in her church any type of birth control is considered wrong.. I'm not sure on that though, since I'm not Catholic myself.",
