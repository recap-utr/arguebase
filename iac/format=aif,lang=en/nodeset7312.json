Does the avalanche abide to your right to liberty as you are trapped? Does the pack of hyenas abide to your right to property as they rob you of food? An inalienable right can only be removed by God. Therefore everything BUT God must respect and abide to it. How can a right that is clearly not abided to be inalienable?",

You're still left with the simple fact that the Declaration of Independance, the premise of your hierarchy of rhetoric, is not legally relevant to the government of the U.S.  The constitution was written after the declaration. Had they wanted to include wording from the declaration, they could have, yet they didn't, did they? Your house of cards is built on a rhetorical slight of hand, trying to persuade by implying somehow that abortion being legal, which it is, in the U.S., right now, should not be allowed. TIP: Trying forming a reasoned argument without such a weak premise, else, your entire argument is just as flawed, which it is. Abortion is legal, for the right reasons.  A conscious, human, U.S. citizen, has rights. Cells, without consciousnes, that are not citizens, do not have rights, are not individuals, and are not humans. You can jump up and down, and post irrelevant things such as the Dec. of Independance, but it doesn't boost your debate credibility. -Mach",

The reality though is there is no single point at which a human life begins: the moment the egg and sperm form, the moment of conception, first division and implantation, the moment the heart starts to beat, the moment of birth etc all mark stages in the formation of a new life.",

Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. If you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes.",

Unfortunately for them, fetuses have never elected pro-lifers to speak their behalf of but instead vice-versa. The pro-life movement plays as a self-appointed representative towards fetuses despite a lack of evidence or substance as to why a fetus, at the moment of conception, has an interest in living.",

So since you don't believe pro-lifers should be the voice maybe we should ask the fetus, we first have to let it learn how to speak first..so by the point it is born and we can't kill it anyway.
