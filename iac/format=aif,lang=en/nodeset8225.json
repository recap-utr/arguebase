      "text": "Any two adults can run the household, one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated, one inherits when the other dies, etc etc. That parallel does not carry over to group marriages. When one dies, who inherits? If one is incapacitied, who decides what the treatment should be? Basically, pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two, so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task, and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious.  If we're talking about legal recognition, and we are (right?), then the cases are wildly different. Our marriage laws, for better or worse, are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household. They also assume man and wife, true, but don't actually depend on that. But the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws; changing that is a huge project.",

      "text": "Yes, but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate THEIR form of marriage as well. The fact that one requires less change than the other shouldn't matter, should it? Should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality? It seems to me your argument boils down to 'polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it.' Yeah--such is the price for marriage equality. Let's face it--if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships, they could pull it off--polygamy, gays, letting 17 year olds marry, etc. All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed. Means could be set up to determine inheritance, for example. Laws can be worded to do it.",

      "text": "Is that really the case? I don't think so. Look at the actual benefits given to married people. Are any of them actually about recognizing a relationship between a man and a woman? No, they're not. They're all about making it easier to build a home, a family, and a life together. That's the real intent of the marriage laws, and there's nothing about building a life together that requires the participants to be of differing genders.",

      "text": "I believe it to be the case that marriage existed prior to any legal recognition of the relationship. If this is true, it seems reasonable to conclude that the state, for whatever reasons, wanted to encourage that particular relationship. Now, if it did so in order to foster an atmosphere where family life can best be nurtured and brought to maturity, that's well and good. But I still disagree with your conclusion that 'there's nothing about building a life together that requires the participants to be of differing genders.' As a general proposition, I agree with this. Two individuals can certainly build a life together without any encouragement from the state. However, in a strict legal sense, there certainly are requirements one must fulfill in order to receive the benefits the state wishes to confer. In other words, legislatures have determined not only that they want to foster and encourage an atmosphere conducive for family life, they have determined that the best way to accomplish this is by encouraging the relationship to be between two individuals of the opposite sex. Now, I will probably say this more than once so that I ensure it has been taken into account: my primary purpose in starting this thread (and my other posts) is not WHETHER the definition of marriage should be changed, but if it is to be changed, WHO should change it.",
