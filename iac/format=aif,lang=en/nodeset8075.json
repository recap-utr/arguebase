I mean, these are the people who already have a supply line and infrastructure. It would obviously have to be modified a little, but I think these would be the people most likely to start legal businesses if it became legal. It would still then be funding the same criminal activities.",

      "text": "So? Isn't that exactly what we would want: people who conduct legal business instead of illegal business? That means less crime, even if organized crime is still into other things. Making a drug illicit effectively creates another market for organized crime. Look at alcohol and prohibition. Alcohol was a huge market for organized crime back in prohibition days. How many mobsters or gangs still have distilleries? They only people who operate illegal distilleries nowadays are indepedant brewers in rural areas. When you can get a wide variety of quality-controlled drugs at a licensed store down the road, no one wants to pay prohibition prices to get goods of uncertain purity or quality. Organized crime goes elsewhere to seek massive profits. I think marijuana is an easy case, its blatantly obvious that most of the harm done by pot on our society comes from associated crime: drug deals gone bad or turf wars, money put into organized crime's hands, otherwise law-abiding citizens put in jail or given criminal records. More dangerous and addictive drugs are a harder sell, I think. Drug education is broken. Often, drug education is distorted to over-emphasize the dangers of drugs, which mystifies the drug, often increases their allure and destroys confidence in the source of information because the information is obviously biased and incomplete. With or without legalization, I believe the best solution to drug abuse is preventative: quality information and education. Reduction of poverty would do a lot to curb drug abuse (and drug-related crime) as well. Also, marijuana use in the Netherlands actually went down after legalization, as did alcohol consumption post-prohibition in the US back in the 30's. I would have to hunt a bit around for references for those facts, though, but those facts show that you can't with certainty expect drug use to increase after legalization.",
