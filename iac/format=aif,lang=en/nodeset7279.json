Haldane famously said that all it would take to falsify evolution is a single Cambrian rabbit fossil, and that is exactly what has been uncovered by paleontologist Dr Wilfred Splenebyrst of the London School of Ergonomics.",

Although I must admit I have never heard of the investigator. And the lagomorph is a very primitive one by all accounts. Still if Haldane admitted this would kick the bucket over then the implications are enormous. One wonders if there are relicts of this species still lurking about - there was that Killer rabbit incident back in the Carter years. There appears to be a thread discussing the implications of these findings on the Pandas Thumb Board http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/11/the_great_debat.html I have not dug through it all yet, but I suspect a consensus will emerge in a few more years. Between the rabbit and the hobbit the evolutionists have a lot on their plates.",
