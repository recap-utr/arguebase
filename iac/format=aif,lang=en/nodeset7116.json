      "text": "To me, part of the point of the 'please, no scripture' comment would be to forgo any insistence that we worship God just because the bible says to. A person could insist that sons pay some form of homage / respect to their father on Father's Fay, but I would argue that it's not reasonable to do so in every case. For example, if the father was physically or sexually abusive, or the father abandoned his children, those would be reasons to fore-go any Father's Day formalities. And 'God' could be viewed as the absent father. Suppose we assume that he created the earth and life on the earth. What's his involvement been since then? Should we worship him just because he's God? Or, depending upon how one sees God, is God a being unworthy of worship and idolization? And along those lines, utilizing the Bible as a reference could be a double-edged sword. The 'God' of the Old Testament ordered slavery, misogyny, genocide, women as spoils of war, ...",
