      "text": "Claims of 'irreducible complexity' simply aren't that complex, they typically amount to one of two things: 1) Defining 'irreducible complexity' in two different ways, and jumping between the two definitions to produce an argument that looks like it proves something but is actually a logical fallacy. e.g. I wish to use the term 'rotten bastard' to mean a man who plays cards. Your husband plays cards, therefore he is a rotten bastard, therefore you should get a divorce. 2) Finding obscure creatures or organs that for various reasons have not well been preserved in a fossil record, and declaring that since we do not know *precisely* how they evolved, they must not have evolved. I'm not sure if you can call this a logical fallacy so much as dishonesty or ignorance of the subtleties of evolutionary processes. e.g. 'I don't understand how a radio works, therefore it must be powered by magic rainbow unicorns'. It is a waste of time reading lengthy arguments which amount to the two featured above, so if you could perhaps cut down the 7 pages to the paragraph or two which do not revolve around these arguments, it might make for a more worthwhile debate.",
