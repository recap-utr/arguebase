It's akin to the argument that if I debate against one thing in science I must be 'anti-science'. (Note: with regards 'The Cross' you were unhappy to be labelled anti-Christian when you debated against one particular thing - the Cross - you should know how I feel :) ) But the nationalist science theory of the poster I addressed struck my interest because he tied it in to a specific series of events; the space race. Even more specifically, the fact that the Soviets beat you. (Note: They also beat you in putting a woman into space, and also in having a 'space-walk') And it seems that the blame for this is twofold a) the poor teaching of science and b) religious people I would like to know - when you talk of 'advantage' what do you mean. Advantage in what way? Are you going to respond with more projection? Or am I not allowed to comment? It's funny it's the 'how dare a non-science person comment on science'.",
