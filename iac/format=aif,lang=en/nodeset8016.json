The idea of 'rights' has gotten dog-gone crazy there . . . they even regulate the nutritional content of food for pets, and require dog-houses have raised floors in them. They've basically done away with a number of illegal drug laws. They're working to BAN handgun ownership altogether. (One has to wonder how we can take their insistence of gay marriage as being constitutional seriously when they are trying to completely ignore the 2nd Amendment!) Despite their liberal regulatory fanaticism, it's actually a very beautiful place to visit!",
