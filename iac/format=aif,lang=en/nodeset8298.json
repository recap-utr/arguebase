Not a single bullet fired! No bomb was set off, no missile was fired, no weapon (i.e., a device that was solely and specifically manufactured to kill humans) was used. A boxcutter!--I can't stop thinking about this. A thousand gun control laws would not have prevented this massacre.' - Michael Moore What does this mean?
