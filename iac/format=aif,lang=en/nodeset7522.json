I will reverse that order, start with his simplest trap, and show the steps that would be necessary to convert it into the next more complex trap in his series. That, after all, is the way Darwinian evolution would have to work. If we are to picture this as a Darwinian process, then each separate adjustment must count as a 'mutation.' If several separate mutations have to occur before we go from one functional trap to the next, then a Darwinian process is effectively ruled out, because the probability of getting multiple unselected mutations that eventually lead to a specific complex structure is prohibitive.",

Now, what I'd like to hear you describe is exactly how intelligent design works in action:  1) How long does intelligent design take, x years or is it instantaneous? 2) By what mechanism does the designer interact with the natural world? 3) When and why does the designer choose to interact with the world? 4) Why has the vast majority of intelligently designed life ceased to exist? if it was designed correctly in the first place why was it necessary to discard so many forms and replace them with different ones, as evidenced by the fossil record? 5) What experiments have been conducted to verify the occurence of intelligent design? I'm most interested to hear your ideas on these points.",

Nowhere.As I originally said, \u00c2\u201cWe can find such an explanation wanting or unsatisfying, but being highly unlikely is not the same as proving it could not happen.\u00c2\u201d This is quite in line with Behe\u00c2\u2019s statements in his book. Further, PROVING it IMPOSSIBLE is what you would have had to have done to PROVE that evolution is false. Behe says it can't be proven impossible: that it can't be completely refuted.(And quite frankly, most of us would agree that claiming that an IC system - or multiple IC systems - arose by multiple simultaneous mutations is in no way comparable to claiming that \u00c2\u201cthe word luckily popped into existence yesterday with all the features it now has.\u00c2\u201d Behe's not being fully honest here.)What I quoted Behe saying is exactly what he said and is his position on the matter. I have NOT misrepresented Behe\u00c2\u2019s position on this.Now, a charge of wrongdoing is discarded unless the party making the accusation can fully support his charge: burden of proof falls upon the accuser, not the accused. You\u00c2\u2019ve failed to support your charge, so I prevail.Now, if you want to continue pushing your charge of wrongdoing on my part, you need to show where, in Behe\u00c2\u2019s \u00c2\u201cDarwin\u00c2\u2019s Black Box\u00c2\u201d, he goes on to show that brute luck is actually impossible: where Behe shows that brute luck can be absolutely and definitively ruled out, 100%. Until you do, you have failed to rebut my counter to your statements, and, I am also cleared of your false charges.PS: The only one playing around with context here is YOU! The context of my statements was that you claimed to have PROVEN EVOLUTION false, and I pointed out that:(1) in order for you to have succeeded, one of several things you would have to do (but didn't) is to DISPROVE multiple, simultaneous mutations (brute luck)and(2) Behe himself says that multiple, simultaneous mutations CANNOT be absolutely ruled out.Try to keep the context, okay.",
