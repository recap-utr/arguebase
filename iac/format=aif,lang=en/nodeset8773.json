However, they seemed very shy on specifying what dates the guns were bought on and when he was discharged. If he bought them after the discharge, then the only ways he could've bought them legally were with a fake ID, bribery, etc.; which actually aren't legal. Oh, and I still wonder if those police officers families would feel better if the guns were illegally obtained... I assure you that even if he did get them semi-legally, he didn't own them legally. The only way he could've got them was by cheating the legal system, and the only way he could've kept them was by hiding them. I'll also acknowledge the possibility that the dealer was lazy with the background check; but no matter what happened, somebody did something illegal.",
