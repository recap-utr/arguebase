That and I would also like to make a clear statement on my childhood, I have been around guns well since I was born... Yet I don't have an extra breathing hole in my head either, so it aint the guns its the parents who don't teach there kids proper gun safety and to NEVER PLAY WITH GUNS! qouting the NRA saftey tips.",
