Theism: Probably can't know, but doesn't realize it. My 'heart/soul/essence/whatever' tells me it is truth. Note: Often impossible to reason with. No scientifically measurable way to prove position. Atheism: Can't know, but thinks and says otherwise. Note: Usually angry. No scientifically measurable way to prove position.",
