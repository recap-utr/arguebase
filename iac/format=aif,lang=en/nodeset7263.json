If this man was a preacher, it looks like he would show where the Bible says that a woman and woman should get married in order to condone same sex marriages.",

      "text": "Actually that passage does not define a marriage. It just says that a man shouldn't divorce his wife. It does say that in the beginning god made man and woman. You can infer whatever you wish about that, but it doesn't explicitly say anything about a marriage being strictly between a man and a woman. Besides, if current laws were actually rooted in the Bible, in this passage, then divorce would be illegal. But our laws are NOT rooted in the Bible, so the passage is irrelevant.  I realize you were addressing a different point but I just had to respond.  Here is the whole context though:",
