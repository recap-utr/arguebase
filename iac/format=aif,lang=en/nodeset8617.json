Having a baby, even giving it up, causes a lot of emotional and phisical pain, and most people just cant have babys. They cannot care for it, and they cannot bear to be thinking that their child is out there somewhere. As I have said before, this is much more complicated than you think. Abortion should always be availible in the first and maybe second trimester, so that women wont have to live the rest of their life in fear and abstinence because they cannot support a baby. This is an interesting article: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15173072/site/newsweek/ I would suggest reading it, just to get a better Idea of our position.",

We don't think a fetus has a negative value and that its best to be rid of as many as possible, its just that they don't have the same value as the well being of the woman. That said I probably wouldn't use terms like 'inherent value' as I don't belieive in that sort of thing. I think that in the context of our society and the rules that allow us to live the lives we more or less want then we need to recognise other people's rights regardless of gender. Its a lot more important to me for a woman to be able to have an abortion than it is for a fetus not to be able to be aborted as the former will have consquences for me but the latter won't (or at least greatly reduced and less definite ones). Its more or less what seperates them from plants and animals (though its a bit wierd one this last point and I'm a massive hypocrite when its comes to this).",
