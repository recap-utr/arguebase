I would have thought that getting those who oppose it to put their opposition on the record before the elections would be beneficial. Then again, seeing as how the lies and fear mongering have already started, I can see how they might want to avoid having the elections muddied with the inevitable dirty fighting that would be thrown at them. Not the most couragous stance, but perhaps safer in the long run. You are right that the longer society fails to collapse the more inane the doomsayers seem.",

And of course the most organized group in Mass. opposing gay marriage is the Mass. Catholic church, and people aren't going to take kindly to a bunch of child rapers telling them what's right and wrong. The anti-gay side really doesn't have much to work with; it'll largely be a contest of good will and common sense vs. scare tactics, and the scare tactics have already been proven wrong.",
