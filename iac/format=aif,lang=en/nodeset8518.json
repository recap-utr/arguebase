      "text": "I think that's overly simplistic. I've spoken with alot of creationists, both in forums and in real life, and many of them are quite intelligent and well educated. The problem is that people have an amazing ability to filter out things that don't fit into their pre-conceived notions. I'm sure you've seen this in all sorts of different fields, it's just most pronounced when someone is denying facts, rather than refuting an opinion. If someone is devoutly religious, and firmly believes in a literal interpretation of the Bible, then facts which contradict that belief simply don't take hold. It's not that they don't understand logic or science. It's more like they've trained themselves to not hear things which go against their beliefs.",

      "text": "All science starts with a presupposition. Evolution presupposes naturalism. One has to start somewhere even if you are sure you are wrong. Science means to know. We owe the vast majority of modern scientific knowledge to people likw Pasteur and Boyles that started with the presupposition on a supernatural creator. A great deal of our knowledge of DNA came from Dr. Crick who believes we evolved from organisms from outer space. Science is science. To say that all scientist do not start with a presupposition is naive.",

On the other hand, it works. It makes predictions and it lets us do such things as make the very computer you are using. What kind of verifiable and repeatable predictions supernaturalism makes??",

      "text": "You couldn't be more wrong. Public TV programs, educational policy statements, and science textbooks have asserted that Darwin's theory of evolution fully explains the complexity of living things. The public has been assured, most recently by spokespersons for PBS's Evolution series, that 'all known scientific evidence supports [Darwinian] evolution' as does 'virtually every reputable scientist in the world.' The following scientists dispute the first claim and stand as living testimony in contradiction to the second. There is scientific dissent to Darwinism. It deserves to be heard.
