The brief literally makes an individualist, strict scrutiny argument (which means it is a fundamental right since only fundamental rights are subject to the strict scrutiny doctrine) then immediatly turns around and basically says 'Except in cases where the government wants to do somethign, then we apply intermediate scrutiny and it is not fundamental'. Bizzare.  Good to see you back, JP. I jsut saw a post from George. Are we all getting a little bored????",
