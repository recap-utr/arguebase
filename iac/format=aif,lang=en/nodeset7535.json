There are a few hothead extremists who sit on London street corners with placards stating that 'UK will be Islamic', 'Sharia Law for UK' etc. etc. But those nutters are ignored along with all the other (non-religious) nutters currently walking the streets of London. (For the record, Muslims make up 2.1 per cent of the total United Kingdom population. They are hardly 'taking over' ). 'muslims are taking over the world' is a poor excuse of a reason to be anti-abortion and shows desperation, IMO!",
