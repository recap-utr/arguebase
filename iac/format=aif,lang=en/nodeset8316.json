If reasoned faith is the same as 'reason', then fine, you aren't using faith. If it's faith, belief without evidence, then your evidence is your faith, and thus, it's circular. If your faith is even part of your 'evidence' or 'reason' for belief, then logically the entire claim is arrived at through circular reasoning. You can use both all you like, I'm just letting you know it's fallacy to claim faith as evidence, which you do. If you do not, then you are using reason, and not faith, and we don't need to continue because I see no fallacy in using evidence to back your claim. Enjoy. I found this as well, maybe it will be worded in such a way that you understand, since you seem to reject my arguments based on my name. http://rous.redbarn.org/objectivism/Writing/JoelKatz/answers2.html",
