Anyway, I honestly don't really see a problem with salvaging things from the dead that are going to benefit the rest of mankind. It sounds icky, and is to a degree but seems better than feeding them to maggots or just burning them. Fair enough if you want have it as an option like Organ Donors but seems the same thing really to me, especially as there are babies that die because they need immediate organ or tissue donors after being born. Its the allegations of babies being killed to fund this I doubt, seems to be an attempt to sensationalise a piece of news. I stand by the original point that there isn't really a medical use for fetus skin as was claimed, some of the organs might be of more use but thats about it.",

Let me just ask you to step in our shoes for just 10 minutes imagine trawling around 100's of hospital labs and medical schools seeing all these poor little babies lined up in jars and i don't mean just a few there is up to 50 in each hospital and school imagine looking at those jars hoping that one of them is your child so you can at lastgive him the burial he/she deserves(a basic human right) yet at the same time praying that none of them are yours. Having done that can you still say that it is only salvage bearing in mind our children were only sent for post mortem and many of us have not seen them since?",

This is the most obscene,disgusting and down right vilest thing i have ever had the misfortune to come across.Do you watch the news or read the papers,because it was all over the national news and the papers so much in fact that the goverment set up an inquiry,and a commitee to deal with it. To say my sons body was salvage is bang out of order and i would thank you to think about the effect that your uncaring words have on people. How long have been on this board,because it is all over the place that fishx{my wife} is staunchly pro life and it would of been more helpful for your case than asking such a stupid question as to ask if she had had an abortion. You live in good old blighty and yet claim no knowledge of what was going on do you not remember alder hey childrens hospital.The system you are discussing is the same system that you live under,it was hope hospital in salford that took my babys body and never returned it.",

There was no selling of stolen dead babies for profit type of business going on with is what Fishx implies with the first post. Sorry, didn't mean to offend there but I still think its better than another baby has a chance to live than pretty much anything with respect to the desceased. If it happened to me I would have no problem at all about any of my organs being used to save lives, either directly or indirectly through training of more doctors or research. Yet, I still respect your wishes and said before that if this is going to happen it should certainly be cleared with the parents first. You're just going to have to accept my appologies and realise that I have no idea what you went through, having not been there myself. Being in an abortion forum, and the nature of the first post it seemed very quite possible that Fishx had had an abortion, though regretted it and wanted the remains to bury - this is a very different case than the one you have unfortunately experienced, hence the question.",
