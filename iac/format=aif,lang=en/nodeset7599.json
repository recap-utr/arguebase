From the article: 'A majority of registered Californian voters...' '... a growing number of Californians ...' 'The poll of 1,052 registered Californian voters ...' The ARTICLE originates in San Fran. The POLL discussed in the article was made across a base of CALIFORNIA voters, most of whom don't live in San Fran.",
