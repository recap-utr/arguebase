This is the formal structure of the ridiculous and false arguments to suggest that abortion is not murder. 'It cannot be murder, because abortion is legal.' Amazingly, you citizen-slaves fall for this illogical and ridiculous rant. The argument is illogical because it pre-supposes that abortion not being murder is valid in the premise. It does not matter if you do it, or the law supposes the premise True. It is also illogical because the definition of murder used has an arbitrary operator ('illegal'), and no legitimate definition can have such an arbitrary operator as a part. The idea that deliberately killing a womb-trapped child is not murder is insane, lie-based and ridiculous.",

      "text": "The purposeful taking of life regulated by the government is something that is decided by the people. The people decide what determines what is allowable and what is not. When it is acceptable and when it is not. This is done in agreement, obviously not unanimous. Theses laws are created by the view of society at the time. Our society permits the ability to change those laws as our values change.  You may call it murder, but you are wrong. There is no logical argument you can present to make your view correct. To suggest that legal abortion is anything else is an expression of your frustration why others don't share your views. There is no logic in your argument it's pure emotion and an immature understanding of how to cope with problems that don't go your way.  If you think your view is indeed the view that is best for the people then be thankful in the US the opportunity exists for you to effect that. I can assure you though lieing about it, sensationalizing it, bullying people about it isn't going to get many people to consider you.  Please do us both a favor before you go off on a discourse of the rights, or feelings or value of the fetus remember what I said about we as a society decided what is acceptable and what is not. We make these laws for ourselves for that reason, because we do attempt to value life. That attempt does not always satisfy all of the people all of the time, but it never will. I don't need a formula to understand how our society functions nor do I stomp my foot and throw insults or intimidate people who don't see you being right. Nor would I justify behavior that from anybody else concerning something of less import would be unacceptable. If you don't like the law, then do something about it. If this is what you deem to be the best and most effective way to do that, I suggest you find a to become comfortable with it.",
