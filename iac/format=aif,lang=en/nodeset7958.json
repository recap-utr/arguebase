      "text": "The link between the current understanding of subsurface hydrology and evolution concerns the age of the water at a given point in a confined aquifer. The water in some confined aquifers is in the order of millions of years old, which is known due to the fact that gravity can only pull so much water from the exposed part of the formation for a given length through rocks of varying transmissivity. This means that technically any fossils in such a rock with water at a given age must be older than the water in the rock, which would provide a minimum age for the fossil.",

Big Fossil geologists consult evolutionary biologists and archelogists for where large concentrations of these organisms were and start looking there. One of the key things they look for in rock samples is the presence of fossils of these diatoms. Now, creationists are going to want to try to change the subject away from providing a product.
