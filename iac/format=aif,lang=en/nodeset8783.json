The common claim was that 5,000-10,000 women died due to complications suffered during illegal abortions. These numbers were never recorded and have now come under great dispute due to the fact that those who used them admitted that they made the numbers up. If you mean to argue, then, that though countless numbers would not die, a few likely would, and thus abortion must remain legal, I think the nature of the claim renders the argument a fallacy. This line of reasoning seems to be saying this: because a few people might break a law, we ought not make the law. But, we wouldn't accept this line of reasoning for any other action. We would never say that because some people break the laws against murder, we should therefore legalize murder. Though a law may be broken, that fact alone could never justify not making the law.",
