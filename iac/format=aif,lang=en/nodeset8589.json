From the door to triage: 2 minutes. Triage to admission: 10 minutes. Examined, treated, and discharged within 30 minutes. Discussion of payment: 0. Never in my life have I had difficulty in seeing any doctor I wanted to, nor have my friends or family members.  All this for far less expenditure per gdp than the US.",
