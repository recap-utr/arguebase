Bush was responsible, it wouldn't be entirely out of the question for dubya to appoint another member of the Christian right to this permission, who might be keen for Christian charities to be promoted. Other possible reasons are that religion is very strong in the south, and hence religious charities are more likely to have resources in the south, were the problem is. In any case, the red cross is by far the largest organisation involved, and as has already been estalbished is secular. And as I said before just because the organisations are Christian doesn't necessarily mean that their workers or contributors are.",
