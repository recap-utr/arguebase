If a non-handicapped person gets mad because they aren't getting disability and others' are, and those who prefer to protect disability try to do so by putting it to a vote, it's pretty disingenuous for the non-handicapped person to say 'voting on fundamental rights like disability is fundamentally flawed'. Disability may be a fundamental right for some people, but the issue is whether or not it is for ALL people.",
