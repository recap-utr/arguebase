A fission reaction in the presence of U-238 always produces plutonium. In fact, about 1/3 of the energy output from a typical reactor in the U.S. comes from the fission of plutonium-239 that is created by the fission of U-235. When there is not enough fissionable material left in the fuel to sustain a reaction, there always remains several isotopes of plutonium that were not present in the original enriched uranium fuel.",
