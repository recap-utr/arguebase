      "text": "Actually, no. A specific fossil cannot be, and probably will never be, identified as the ancestor of birds with any certainty. It is doubtful that the fossil record will ever be so complete as to make that possible. Your remark tends to support the confusion of creationists. They tend to represent the idea of a transitional as ancestral. Since the ancestral status of any particular fossil can't be acertained for any given fossil, and since any given fossil is usually placed in one of the major taxonomic groups, creationists feel justified in claiming that it is just a bird - thus, no transitionals exist. But if you look at life you will see that it is like a bush with many branches. What is being discovered in China is part of the bush that was the lineage from theropod to avian, as was Archaeopteryx. That bush is what is expected from evolutionary theory. There are several fossils that show a progression from dinosaur to bird. We don't expect a ladder-like chain of a single lineage that evolved until a point that it branched into the birds. There are many lines along that path that went no where but were similar to the one that became the birds.",
