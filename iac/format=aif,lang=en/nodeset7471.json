Explain exactly how the judges ruling that the Second Amendment is truly an individual right, how DC's ban on handgun ownership and their trigger lock requirements being unconstitutional, would in any way suggest that one-gun-a-month laws pass constitutional muster. Furthermore how to you reconcile the effects of gun rationing, with the fact that such laws make it absolutely impossible to catch gun traffickers in the act?  Give us some straight answers or leave the debate!",
