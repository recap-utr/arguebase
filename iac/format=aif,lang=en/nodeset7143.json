Would you please point to the artical or amendment that they are mentioned?  So you don't care about seperation of church and state? Would you feel the same if the laws reflect the dietary laws that are mentioned in leviticus? Would you feel the same way if the majority of yuour neighbors were satinists and the majority of the community voted to only allow the church of satin to exsist and all members of the community had to attend? See the seperation of chruch and state protects everyone. It protects the state from influencing the church and the church from influencing the state. The wall must stay up.",
