Are you trying to imply that, because a baby is sometimes breast-fed, it retains a biological connection to the mother similar to the umbilical cord? I'd call that stretching the boundaries of 'biological connection', personally... Before birth, if the mother dies, the foetus dies (with one noticable exception that I know of). After birth, this is no longer the case.",
