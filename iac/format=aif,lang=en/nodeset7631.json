My God man! You have just confirmed the existence of Papasmurfidae!  I wouldn't pontificate on the nature of the scriptures based upon a quick glance any more than I would attempt to determine the origin of the species by glossing through Ask Jeeves. I can tell you however that jacob begetting enoch and enoch begetting Ralph, etc etc etc, does not approach the current acceptable age of the earth Sir. Even if you allow for Methuselah to live 900 years. Describe the shape of your skull sir. Perhaps a break through awaits. As for my own skull, it is deforming with each successive post from repeated blows to the forehead by my open palm.  If the lack of complete records has you befuddled, consider my own curiousity at the utter dearth of evidence for a planet of an age described in the bible. Evolutionists may not have all of the puzzle pieces in place, but one can determine what the picture looks like. I can't think of one piece that would support the view to which you subscribe.",
