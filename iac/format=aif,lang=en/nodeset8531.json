All honor to Dr. George Tiller, who joins the list of martyrs for ethical decency and human rights, killed for healing with compassion. He is a religious martyr in the fullest classical sense, killed in his own church as he arrived to worship, killed for acting in accord with his religious commitments and his moral and ethical choices. And all dishonor to those vicious attackers like Bill O'Reilly who have egged on the kind of violence that finally murdered Dr. Tiller. And who have blasphemously invoked the name of God to justify these incitements to murder.",

      "text": "The Killing of George Tiller: A 'Pro-life' Murder?'Pro-life' as the self-description of the anti-abortion movement has a fundamental flaw at its heart. The moral absolute of 'life' is not applied consistently, in my view, by the majority of those in this movement. Many in the 'pro-life' anti-abortion movement seem to me to only be pro-life in the case of abortion -- unlike those who hold an ethic of life across a range of moral issues, not only abortion but also war and the death penalty, This makes 'pro-life' in regard to abortion not only an inconsistent ethic, but an unstable one.Nothing exposes this fundamental inconsistency and instability in the ethic of life as a description of the anti-abortion movement more than 'pro-life' murder..... Violence has been a part of the anti-abortion movement from the beginning, from the overt violence of the murder of other abortion providers to the covert violence of harassing women trying to get to clinics for reproductive services.Violence is a logical outcome of the extreme self-righteousness of those who claim the 'pro-life' label as an absolute and yet who do not have an actual, consistent ethic of life such as the views held by pacifists. Dr. Charles Kimball, a Baptist minister and professor of religion at Wake Forest University, well explains this logical connection in his book When Religion Becomes Evil. According to Kimball, two warning signs that indicate a religious viewpoint is becoming evil are 'absolute truth claims' and 'the end justifies any means.' Violence, in Kimball's view, is an evil.",

One thing that these two violent societies share is having a group of rabid religious fundamentalists who are each on a jihad against those in their nation with whom they disagree, and who are ready to kill and maim their enemies without mercy or hesitation. The other thing -- perhaps the more dangerous thing -- that they share is a government apparatus in which certain elements are overtly or surreptitiously supportive of the jihadists, and in which other elements are cowed into silence and inaction.",

From Wednesday alone, he 'could read a hundred' messages spewing 'hate that's not based in fact,' much of it about Barack Obama and some of it sharing the museum gunman's canard that the president was not a naturally born citizen. These are Americans 'out there in a scary place,' Smith said. Then he brought up another recent gunman: 'If you're one who believes that abortion is murder, at what point do you go out and kill someone who's performing abortions?' An answer, he said, was provided by Dr. George Tiller's killer. He went on: 'If you are one who believes these sorts of things about the president of the United States ...' He left the rest of that chilling sentence unsaid.",

A screen capture of the comment, made on the Internet site Facebook, was obtained by FITSNews, the website of South Carolina politico Will Folks. The image shows a post by an aide to state Attorney General Henry McMaster describing Friday morning's gorilla escape at Columbia's Riverbanks Zoo. Longtime SCGOP activist and former state Senate candidate Rusty DePass responded with the comment, 'I'm sure it's just one of Michelle's ancestors - probably harmless.' DePass told WIS News 10 he was talking about First Lady Michelle Obama. DePass has been involved in state politics for decades, and helped elect Republican Governor Jim Edwards in 1974. He was an early South Carolina supporter of former President George W. Bush in 2000....",
