It brings in the full spectrum light in high lumens, but, because it's glass - it blocks harmful rays.  Does anyone here have knowledge of where I might acquire the supplies necessary to conduct such experiments?",

      "text": "Hi Smallax, welcome to the forum. I did a search and have found some products which might give you an idea about costs and concepts for performing such an experiment. It sounds interesting by the way. First, I found Glass Bell jars that are safe at high pressure. https://www1.fishersci.com/wps/portal/PRODUCTDETAIL?productId=685878&catalogId=29101&pos=6&catCode=SE_SC&fromCat=yes&keepSessionSearchOutPut=true&brCategoryId=58138&hlpi=y&fromSearch= Here's a Nalgene vacuum chamber as another option to the Bell Jar depending on the pressure you're going to use. https://www1.fishersci.com/wps/portal/PRODUCTDETAIL?productId=700548&catalogId=29101&pos=10&catCode=SE_SC&fromCat=yes&keepSessionSearchOutPut=true&brCategoryId=58138&hlpi=y&fromSearch= Here's a motor driven vacuum pump: https://www1.fishersci.com/wps/portal/PRODUCTDETAIL?productId=6308161&catalogId=29101&pos=3&catCode=SE_SC&fromCat=yes&keepSessionSearchOutPut=true&brCategoryId=58138&hlpi=y&fromSearch= Here's a precalibrated absolute zero apparatus: https://www1.fishersci.com/wps/portal/PRODUCTDETAIL?productId=697104&catalogId=29101&pos=4&catCode=SE_SC&fromCat=yes&keepSessionSearchOutPut=true&brCategoryId=58138&hlpi=y&fromSearch= This link gives a wide range of products that you might want to be aware of for a wider selection of potential equipment: https://www1.fishersci.com/wps/portal/BROWSEHIERARCHY?catalogId=29101&categoryId=58138&brtype=Category&supplierId=0&agSupplierName=&browseHierarchy=29101%7C56795%7C56856%7C56862%7C58138&catCode=SE_SC Here's a fiber optic system which is interesting and utilizes natural light: Huvco Daylighing Solutions | Parans Fiber Optic Systems | Tubular Skylights | High Performance Skylights Here's another design but is a different company: SUNLIGHT DIRECT Keep us informed if you run the experiment. I'd be interested in the results.",
