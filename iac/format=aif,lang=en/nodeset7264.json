Fossils Yield 10-Million-Year-Old Bone Marrow -- A First http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/07/060725-fossil-bone.html Fossilized bone marrow has been discovered in ten-million-year-old frogs and salamanders from an ancient lake bed in Spain, scientists announced Friday.  The specimens are the first examples of fossilized bone marrow ever to be discovered. They are so well preserved that the original color of the tissue is still visible.  'The marrow is organically preserved,' McNamara said. 'The original color of the marrow is preserved. Like modern frogs, she says, the bones show an inner zone of yellow, fatty marrow, encircled by an outer zone of red marrow.' or this: Fossil Meat Found in 380-Million-Year-Old Fish http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070212-fossil-tissue_2.html this is a pretty good trick for a creature that is over a third of a billion years old!
