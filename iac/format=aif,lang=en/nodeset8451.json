      "text": "A baby may look helpless. It can\u00c2\u2019t walk, talk, think symbolically or overhaul the nation\u00c2\u2019s banking system. Yet as social emulsifiers go, nothing can beat a happily babbling baby. A baby is born knowing how to work the crowd. A toothless smile here, a musical squeal there, and even hard-nosed cynics grow soft in the head and weak in the knees.In the view of the primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the extraordinary social skills of an infant are at the heart of what makes us human. Through its ability to solicit and secure the attentive care not just of its mother but of many others in its sensory purview, a baby promotes many of the behaviors and emotions that we prize in ourselves and that often distinguish us from other animals, including a willingness to share, to cooperate with strangers, to relax one\u00c2\u2019s guard, uncurl one\u00c2\u2019s lip and widen one\u00c2\u2019s pronoun circle beyond the stifling confines of me, myself and mine.As Dr. Hrdy argues in her latest book, \u00c2\u201cMothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding,\u00c2\u201d which will be published by Harvard University Press in April, human babies are so outrageously dependent on their elders for such a long time that humanity would never have made it without a break from the great ape model of child-rearing. Chimpanzee and gorilla mothers are capable of rearing their offspring pretty much through their own powers, but human mothers are not.",

Also, I worked with emotionally unstable children aged 3 and older, and observed what a delightful species the three-year-olds are.
