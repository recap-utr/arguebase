What you think is not reflective of the reality of women and their cicumstances that exist in the world. The reasons to abort are numerous and complicated. Some reasons are more valid than others. But you have no way of knowing that for millions of women, only they can really know. And although there are some youngsters in this forum who negate life experience, it is not to be negated. Ther is a lot to be said for 'walking in a mile in another's shoes'. Be careful about your desire to take the life circumstances of a stranger in your hands.
