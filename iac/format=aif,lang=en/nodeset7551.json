      "text": "DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) -- Sen. Sam Brownback, who wants to champion social conservatives in the presidential race, said Tuesday he wants a Senate panel to re-question a judicial nominee who attended a same-sex union ceremony. Brownback, a Kansas Republican, said he wants Michigan state judge Janet Neff to testify about her role in the 2002 Massachusetts ceremony, her legal views on same-sex unions and her ability to be impartial if called upon to rule on such cases. Neff's nomination to a federal district court is among a dozen or so now stalled in the Senate, a logjam in part due to Brownback's questions about Neff's attendance at a lesbian commitment ceremony. The Senate Judiciary Committee has already approved her nomination. Neff was traveling outside the country and could not immediately be reached for comment, said Chris Bockheim, her judicial assistant. Earlier this month, Brownback, a prominent opponent of gay marriage who is exploring a presidential run in 2008, said he would lift the hold he put on Neff's nomination if the judge agreed to withdraw from ruling on any court case involving the legality of same sex unions. http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/12/19/brownback.judge.ap/index.html?eref=rss_politics  Doesn't this just REEK of hypocrisy and partisanship? He wants to question this judge because she was PRESENT at a same-sex ceremony. I wonder if similar questions are asked of judges to ensure that they can remain impartial if they view homosexuality as a sin... 'exploring a presidential run...' ??? Sounds like yet another Republican attempt to garner votes off of anti-gay hysteria.",

      "text": "Well, this is not very surprising coming from Brownback. I live in Kansas City Missouri, but work over on the Kansas side, so I know plenty about Brownback. He's been quite a bastard toward gay related issues over the years, and I think the same goes for abortion in his case. If he's the Republican nominee for the presidential election, boy am I voting Democrat just on that principle, not to mention the fact I haven't voted Republican since George W.  You know, maybe they should question judges that have attended hetero marriages as to their impartiality as well as those who attend churches that vocally state their anti-gay views. emoticon_xangel EDIT: Yep, just checked, and he IS strongly pro-life, having referred to the amount of abortions in the United States since Roe V. Wade as 'a holocaust', and is also one of the Kansas officials in favor of teaching Intelligent Design alongside Evolution. He also opposes stem cell research.",
