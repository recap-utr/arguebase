      "text": "I am curious as to why you specifically exclude self defense as a valid reason for owning a gun. Data from the FBI shows that victims who resist an aggressor by use of a gun are less likely to be injured than when they use other weapons for defense. I would think that this alone would validate the ownership of a gun for defensive use. On a related note, as was recently confirmed by the SCOTUS, owning a firearm is an individual right. I am not aware of any other right that you are required to to demonstrate a reason prior to exercising.",

When this occurs, you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms. If you read around you'll see that I consider all rights as needing justification. This comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a UK citizen, where there is no formalised Constitution. Ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified, why should it be treated as a 'right'?",
