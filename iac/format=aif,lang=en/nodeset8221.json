      "text": "Peer-Reviewed Stealth ID Classic : The Anthropic Cosmological Principle (1987) Frank Tipler co-authored a book with John Barrow entitled The Anthropic Cosmological Principle which was a peer-reviewed book published by Oxford University in 1987. The principle thesis: Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the Universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out. They derive the thesis from Schrodinger's equation Schrodinger's Equation From Schrodinger's equation they derive the following formula: Universal Wave Function which predicts, through physical first principles alone, at the end of time that there must be an Intelligent Entity that is conscious, all-powerful, all-knowing, non-material, eternal. By all counts, such an entity would properly be called, 'God'.",

We just let the evidence of Schrodinger's equation and the Heisenberg Uncertaint principle lead us to the fact that God exists. emoticon_wow   I don't know if anyone can actually 'debate' me on this. I just wanted to point out some ID ideas that are comical and wouldn't be so scary if ID people didn't take them seriously.",

      "text": "The universe-as-computer concept may also play into the current strife about intelligent design. It might be argued that a computer implies a programmer. However, this may be taking the analogy too far. What the universe is computing, in Lloyd\u00c2\u2019s picture, is not some external output but rather its own behavior. And a very large portion of its computing power seems to be tied up in such behavior as random collisions of atoms.What a way to spin this. This actually favors ID. If the majority of the computational resources are wasted, it reduces the amount of probabilistic resources.\u00c2\u201cmonkeys typing on computers can produce simple code that would generate a wide variety of outputs.\u00c2\u201dI\u00c2\u2019d like to see that. (Is he trying to make monkeys out of Stephen Wolfram et al?)Elsewhere, Seife uses terminology that is likely to create confusion. He posits a possible \u00c2\u201claw of conservation of information,\u00c2\u201d without noting that Intelligent Design theorist William Dembski has used the same wording to propose a different law. Seife is referring to [blah blah blah]. All of which has nothing to do with Dembski\u00c2\u2019s claim that organisms contain information that could not have been produced naturally.Transparent, intellectually dishonest obfuscation.Comment by j \u00c2\u2014 March 9, 2006 @ 6:47 am",
