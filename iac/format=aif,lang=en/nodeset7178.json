In other words, what pieces of a 'traditional' ceremony would you keep and which would you decide are too 'hetero'? I am sure this question seems bizarre but I thougt that would make it more thought provoking, not to mention I am serious. I am going to have a ceremony and was looking for ideas. Figured you guys might have some at the same time debate the issue of what makes a ceremony or union similar and different.",

As for a ceremony: If were to ever get married, I think it would be relatively small (50 to 100 people max) and out in a an open meadow (weather permitting), or at least a lush green park or back yard. My partner and I would escort each other up the aisle in matching grey tuxes, to a simple platform with a white garden archway decorated in white flowers, where a justice of the peace presides over a simple ceremony. We would read vows to one another and then be pronounced partners in life, and then just have a fabulous garden party. How doeas that sound?",

I will warn you though. Canadian marriage laws state that even though you do not have to be a resident of Canada to get married, you do have to be a Canadian resident for no less than one year to get divorced.
