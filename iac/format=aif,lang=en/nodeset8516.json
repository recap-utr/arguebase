Who, with one hand, sell the very weapons they condemn with the other. That is your real contradiction",

I think the Pro-lifers have an edge on the contradiction between abortion and the death penalty because one is the ending of an innocent life, while the other is of a guilty person's life. I think every soldier who gives his life in a justified or an ambiguous war should be honored by all Americans for giving his or her life for their country, and yes, I do believe they are patriots!",
