The SOHO project (with which I was indirectly involved, and know some of the participants) was launched on December 2, 1995 specifically to make high precision measurements of the sun, especially the oscillations of the size of the surface, which indicate details of the interior. To quote them: Is the Sun expanding or contracting, and at what rate? (For an overview of the controversy over solar diameter variations, I recommend John Gribbin's pre-SOHO book, Blinded By the Light: The Secret Life of the Sun, published in 1991) The Sun is not currently expanding or contracting to any measurable extent. It may in fact be shrinking or swelling, but we have no hard data with which to conclude that. It is vibrating, however: http://helios.tuc.noao.edu/helio.html (Global Oscillation Network Group) http://soi.stanford.edu (The Solar Oscillations Investigation) In addition, we expect that the Sun will someday expand into a red giant phase, but that won't be for another 4 billion to 5 billion years or so.

It used to keep pretty good time and require resetting only about every six months but it broke and I had to replace the works. It has taken a good six months to adjust the speed to the point that it is now off by only about a minute/week. I'm still adjusting. That's what is happening with the 'leap seconds' that occur from time to time. The adjustment is primarily to sync up two clocks keeping slightly different times, one of which is very accurate, the other of which varies and is slowing at the rate of 0.005 sec/year/year.",
