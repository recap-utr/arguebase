While trekking through the middle of no-where they stumble across an igloo. The Priest exclaims: 'it's a miracle!' The Humanist dismisses it saying: 'don't be silly, man must have made it' Then the biologist pipes up: 'wait a minute' After jotting down notes and referring to his books for about an hour he says: 'yes, after scientifically analyzing the facts it's obvious to me that over a period of about 1000 years this snow shelter evolved'",
