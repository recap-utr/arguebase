No change, more pro choice, or more pro life? Why? Before you answer, take a second to actually invision that society.",

You could argue it would shift opinion towards the mix currently held by women as everyone would be in the position of having to bear pregnancy. Given that there is a full mix of religious and other beliefs in the current day female population perhaps this would be a good analogy to such a state of being you suggest.",
