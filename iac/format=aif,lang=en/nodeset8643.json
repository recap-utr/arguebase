      "text": "I won't throw my ideas on abortion out there just yet, but I have to ask this question. Should fathers have to pay child support considering a mother could have mitigated the expense by having an abortion? For example: Jack is 55 and makes 20,000 a year. Jack gets injured by Bob, and can no longer work unless he gets a $1000 operation. Jack's religion or other views preclude getting the operation, so he sues Bob for $200,000, the wages he'll lose over the next ten years. Since Jack could mitigate his losses by having the operation, nost likely all he will be entitled to is $1000. So- shouldn't child support be limited to the cost of an abortion, under our current pro-abortion laws?",

And this results sometimes is someone becoming ' with child ' even though it was not what they set out to do! So should we force them to have the child and put it up for adoption?

After than point he has in effect signed a blank check. It's like the old saw, if you don't want to do the time, don't do the crime. Fathers to be shouldn't be engaging in sex unless they intend to pony up with the montly check.  I come from a bit of a bias on this subject because this was my area of endeavor for some 20+ years.",
