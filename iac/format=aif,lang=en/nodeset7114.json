Whether it is a witness at a trial or a deposition, member of a jury or a grand jury, use of the Bible and even the words, '...so help me God.' are not required. Any person may refuse the Bible and the words and instead opt to make an affirmation. All that is necessary is to inform the judge that you prefer to do so. Everyone else may take the oath and then anyone who desires makes an affirmation. In the affirmation there is no 'swearing,' merely a promise. The affirmation carries the same expectations and penalties as the oath. A friend did so in a court once. He didn't know what kind of reaction from the attorneys and judge to expect. He got no reaction whatsoever. The clerk just put down the Bible and administered the affirmation. This is from Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, regarding the President:",

Jesus contradicted the Old Testament. The Bible is the inspired word of God, not a dictation to scribes. Men wrote the allegories describing the creation of things. Saying that mankind took a long time to understand certain things is not limiting the power of God. He could have chosen to make early man Einsteinian, but He didn't. He could have chosen for mankind to bypass the flat-earth concept, but He didn't. He could have chosen for all humans to be highly intelligent, but He didn't. What He did was to leave us alone and let us figure things out on our own, including how long it took to get where we are now.",
