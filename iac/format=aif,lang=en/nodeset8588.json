Last I checked, it took a long time for enough of a human's teeth to erupt in order to vigorously chew meat. Once again, supersport has proposed an idea that we can test scientifically. All he has to do is secure guardianship of a newborn and feed said newborn a nice, healthy, high-in-protein diet requiring heavy chewing. If the child ends up looking like a Neanderthal, supersport will be vindicated. What are you waiting for, supersport? Oh, I get it: you're doing to do the peppered moth experiment first, right? Then you'll do the Great Dane \u00d7 Chihuahua to produce Chihuahuas experiment. Only then will you get around to this one... To respond to some of the other comments in this thread: supersport was eventually banned from IIDB for ignoring directions of moderators. While there, he averaged over 50 posts per day of trolling. His points were -- without fail -- repeatedly slapped down in the most convincing fashion imaginable: IIDB is crawling with experts in various fields, evolutionary and molecular biology certainly not excepted. Every time supersport's argument would get slaughtered indisputably from countless angles, he'd abandon the thread and start a new one, usually saying pretty much the same thing. supersport has said that nobody from there dares come over here to debate him. I know that Collin and I are both here and on IIDB; the fact that the majority of the people over there make me look like a novice coupled with the fact that supersport hasn't fared too well here should tell anybody who has any semblance of reasoning that supersport is once again talking out of his XXX. Don't take his word for it, but you don't have to take my word for it, either: head over to IIDB and do a search for threads started by supersport. It'll only take the first couple of pages to see him thrashed, but I certainly won't stop you from reading more of the carnage.",

      "text": "There's a huge hole in evolutionary theory and I'm about to exploit it. I've mentioned this before, but truly, mountains of books could be written on this subject. The subject, of course, is the illusion of evolution. My contention is that much of what is perceived as 'evolution' is not actually not evolution at all. Part of the problem 20th century scientists had was their definition of 'evolution.' Intellectual wars have been fought for the past 150 years about where new traits come from and how they get passed on. Regardless, each side has tried to explain how the information from the environment gets transmitted to offspring. On one side you have Darwinists, who claim that evolution is a two-step process. First there's random genetic mutation, and that's followed up by non-random natural selection....the two combine to have the effect of transmitting environmental 'fitness' to their offspring. Lamarckian inheritance, on the other hand, is a one-step process where the organism simply perceives the environment, adapts phenotypically and passes on these adaptations to their progeny. But there's a hole. A gaping hole that nobody has seemed to exploit. And this hole bypasses both theories. What's the hole? The hole is that inheritance of new traits is not necessary for 'evolution.' In other words, populational evolution does not require traits to be 'passed on.' This mantra is a giant straw man, as you will soon see, because much -- if not all -- of what we see in the field is merely a matter of environmental evolution. The reality is that a change in phenotype is observed as evolution in the field and in the fossil record. But there is no way to tell from the fossils -- or from non-controlled scientific experiments -- whether new traits are caused by variation arising in the genotype or only from environmental effects acting on the phenotype. Not only that, but there's also no way to tell without close inspection if these traits are inherited or acquired.  It's well known that animal embryo development brings about a collaboration between the genetic program, internal signals from the mother, and external signals from the environment. Somehow the embryo processes this information and emerges accordingly. Therefore, the same genome can emerge with different phenotypes depending on environment or external circumstance. This is known as differentiation, and is simply the convergence of an organism's genes and environment during development. Moths and butterflies are perfect example of this phenomenon. As well, tadpoles can not only change the size and shape of their heads, it's also known that the presence of predators can influence their tail size, shape, color, hatch times and general size of the organism.  (Could this be why Neanderthals had their brow ridges? Since they had a slightly protruding face (as many in Europe still do), the exertion that no-doubt came from eating a diet heavy in meat (vigorous chewing) could very well have put pressure on the facial plates and brow ridges -- and as youngsters with soft bones, this diet help dictate their morphology.) But it's not just tadpoles........ As well, rodents, will dine on a variety of seeds and nuts...as youngsters, if a population of mice come across a new food supply, they are all likely to all develop a morphology that suits such a diet. If this food is different than what their parents' ate, their morphology could be uniquely different than their parents. This new morphology would follow them until adulthood. If the food supply stuck around long enough time, it could give the appearance that the population was 'evolving.' But genetics would have nothing to do with it - instead, it would simply be a cultural, environmental phenomenon. It's an environmental evolution, of sorts. Of course this leaves natural selection out of a job because the entire population would be evolving new, beneficial morphologies without it. Not only that but it bypasses the ridiculous premise that science has constructed for itself --- which says that new, beneficial traits have to be 'passed on.' This is a bogus premise from the very start because it's not necessary for traits to be 'passed on' for new morphologies to carry forward into future generations -- all that's needed is, in this case, for a specific diet to continue to be available to future generations -- which, of course, would carry on those particular traits. 'We think licking affects a methylation enzyme that is ready and waiting for mother to start licking,' Dr. Meaney said. In perilous times, mothers may be able to set the stress reactivity of their offspring by licking less. When there are fewer dangers around, the mothers may lick more. [/COLOR] Really the sky's the limit; diet, terrain, movement, predators, weather, availability of resources, etc. Life is not about genes, Life is about life. The designer didn't create animals adapted to specific environments, He created them with an adaptive ability to evolve with a changing environment. This is not 'evolution' it's an adaptive response. Of course, some say new beak shapes could have formed during development, but either way, selection is not required....it would be similar situation to the butterfly example I gave above. This of course, is just another example where it is not necessary for traits to be 'passed on.' Traits need not be passed on to give the illusion of populational evolution.  And what's interesting is Gould's explanation for why Lamarckism is false...this is very interesting and ties in directly to this:  Of course, Gould has set up a giant straw man that has been repeated relentlessly. The straw man is that it's not necessary pass on traits, for the reasons stated above....and it is not necessary that 'environments or acquired adaptations can direct sex cells to mutate in specific directions.' Life gets around that little scenario because each life is individually adaptive...and adaptations start during development -- where his eyes couldn't see -- or didn't want to. Life changes so rapidly -- if you blink you miss it! Stephen, I know you're dead, but if you can somehow hear me, please note you have made a great error.....you have a giant hole in your theory, which I have just exploited. It's called 'The Environmental Evolution Revolution.' Not only have I undercut your snails but I've undercut most of what you and all your foolish friends say in your books. Evolution surely has a heritable component, but a huge portion of what is perceived as 'evolution' in the field is not that at all. It's merely an illusion...and upon close inspection it disappears altogether....just like your theory. You see, there is NO EVIDENCE for natural selection sifting through random mutations. What is seen in the field today is not evidence for that, it's simply evidence that the environment is working on the genetic code of each creature.",

      "text": "He is not taken seriously because he gathers information only with his Morton's demon in full control. supersport ploughs around the intarwebs, looking for anything he can crib and misrepresent. He's gotten really good at cribbing and misrepresenting, but that doesn't mean that he can't be refuted... or hasn't been refuted... or hasn't been refuted repeatedly... or hasn't been refuted repeatedly on numerous discussion boards... If supersport spent half as much effort reading and understanding what bona fide scientists tell him as he spends looking for 'support' and figuring out how to spin it, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Let's put it this way. Suppose you have a friend named Fred who is in your section of organic chemistry. One day your friend comes in and says, 'Dude! The prof's off his rocker! I have proof that he's lying to us!' You ask Fred for some supporting evidence, and he disappears for a while. A while later, you see Fred again. 'Dude,' he says, 'I told you. Check this out. Turns out that there are ways besides the so-called 'Grignard reaction' to lengthen carbon chains. Wittig! It's all a ruse! He's been telling us about this, but that's not what actually happens! (And man, don't get me started on keto-enol tautomerization; that one's a real doozy!)' You stare at him blankly, point him to the appropriate scientific papers, even invite him into the lab to run the experiment himself, but all he does is tout his own brilliance and avoid every piece of evidence you provide. Finally, Fred comes into lecture and tells you about his amazing theory that will totally overthrow all of organic chemistry. It turns out that sulfur can catenate, too, he says. This completely destroys the scientific conspiracy that organic chemistry is really about carbon compounds. In fact, Fred ends up approaching the professor -- someone who has extensive education, training, and experience in the field -- and tells the professor outright that Fred has uncovered the scientists' evil plan to corrupt mankind and indoctrinate poor little college students into 'Grignardism.' Incredibly, Fred doesn't seem to notice that other students, the professor, graduate assistants, scientific articles, and common sense all contradict him. When presented with these problems, Fred pooh-poohs them away as a fabricated part of the conspiratorial establishment, as science as a whole has only one purpose: promoting Grignardism. Fred repeats this every week, with the same argument every time, dressed up just a little bit different. Every week, dozens upon dozens of refutations pour in, inundating little Fred with questions he can't answer and observations he can't explain. When even Fred -- the practiced little spinster that he is -- can no longer pretend in the face of such overwhelming evidence, he disappears again... Only to start anew the next week. How long until you no longer take Fred seriously? Do you think I've made up this whole scenario? Head over to IIDB and search for threads started by supersport. My story is a sadly accurate representation, although it is much too short to instill in you the understanding of the full depth of supersport's... 'behavior.' IIDB has numerous practicing scientists and generally well-educated people; they thrashed sport to pieces every single time. He finally made himself a nuisance and repeatedly broke forum rules so that he'd be banned and could claim that moderators kicked him off because they couldn't debate him.",
