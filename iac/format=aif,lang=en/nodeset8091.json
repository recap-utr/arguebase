So, I'd say yes we evolved it (I think god 'attaches' it to us when our minds develop), and it occured with the dawn of sentience. b) The 'first sin' is something that has always existed ever since death existed. I don't view it as a particular event (Adam and Eve myth is a sort of metaphor or way of talking about it). Jesus came to take that sin away, allowing us to overcome death in eternity.",
