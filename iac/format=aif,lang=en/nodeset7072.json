Your intent might be misinterpreted by some who have not read 'Origin' and are unfamiliar with Darwin thoughts. To the uninformed, your claim about what Darwin said could easily be misinterpreted to mean that even accidental changes to the environment by man that cause evolutionary change in populations is 'artificial selection.' Of course, you couldn't have meant that, since that is clearly not what Darwin was talking about. The context of the quote that you cite makes that clear. The whole context of the quote is in the chapter on Variation Under Domestication. Darwin does not discuss accidental changes to the environment in that chapter. That certainly would be more confusing than profitable in a chapter in which Darwin was attempting to explain the basics of his theory with examples from domestic animals, especially pigeons. It is abundantly clear that Darwin was referring to the selection by man of breeding stock since he remarks that in the domestication of a species man '...intentionally or by chance picked out...' characteristics. Of course, by use of the word 'chance', Darwin meant characteristics that existed in the individuals of the breeding stock that were selected for other reasons, i.e., intentionally.",

For example, Nobel prize winner, George Wald, wrote, 'Time is the hero of the plot. Given enough time anything can happen - the impossible becomes probable, the improbable becomes certain.'

Huxley used this argument to demonstrate that life could have originated on Earth by chance. (2)",

Individual organisms may work to survive, but they also work to reproduce. That's as close as it gets to 'purpose.' And as you know, Darwin's favored term was natural selection. He never used the phrase 'survival of the fittest' without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. Since Darwin's time 'survival of the fittest' has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory.",

      "text": "'They believe that mechanistic evolution is just too improbable.' Ah... do they now. You see, Berkinski et al seem to have a limited comprehension as to what causes life to change in space and time. Where they see improbability I see inevitability- life, in whatever form we care to discuss, is vying to survive against a whole battery of challenges. Some of those challenges confront it on a short term basis- the need for food, suitable environmental conditions in which to survive and so on. Others may be an issue over a longer period of time- the need to find a mate and reproduce, can it survive annual changes in local climates. Ultimately, life has to be able to adapt to the longest term changes- like a major shift in underlying climatic conditions or local topography. And so on- we can consider a whole host of changes that confronts life at various times over different timescales. What is clear from such consideration is the never ending need for life to able to adapt- the Earth is a dynamic and forever changing place (even the very ground beneath you now is transient in nature) and environments have changed dramatically over the course of this planets history. If life were still and static it would never have come to be in the first place. If it can not adapt to a new challenges quickly enough- well just think of all the examples we have of life that is extinct. So I really cannot see why Berkinski and his peers find natural evolution, or whatever you care to call it improbable- the driving forces are there to see if you are inclined to learn about them. What I really find improbable is the notion of an omnipotent supernatural enitity outside of the physical universe somehow being able to comprehend and interact with the life in ours- and even to have the desire to do so!",

In the analogy the guidance by humans represents natural selection. You could represent the rules of natural selection as set of equations with random elements that contained no human ingenuity instead but I don't see it as a crime to use a human forced to act under restrictions to represent that has nothing to do with humans. I will show you You could describe electrons as things that hate other electrons but like positive charges. If some electrons see other electrons coming at them down a wire they will also move down the wire to avoid them. If it means going through a circuit an powering a light globe to do the electrons will still flow if the circuit is complete. Now lets think about whats happening, each indivual electron hates large group of electrons coming towards it but to get out of the way it will have to get closer to other electrons (those punks). So if you increased the cross sectional area of the wire then the resistance will decrease. What about a double adaptor? All it does is let the current go through two different circuits. Now if there are two light globes will they both glow half as bright? No. Why because the resistance is halved and there will be twice as much total electron flow.  A lot of laws in electric circuit theory made sense to me when I imagined I was an electron going through a wire and how happy I would be going down a wire. Electrons are not happy but I still had an analogy that gave me answers so I was happy. I would have been better off being told that voltage is joules per coloumb so the voltage drop between circuits must be the same.",

It should be quite clear to even the most muddled thinker that reproduction is required. In fact, reproduction is the most important requirement. Survival is necessary only long enough for an organism to reproduce, and if an organism doesn't reproduce, it is an evolutionary dead end no matter how long it survives.

As I mentioned in a previous post, without further criterion, 'survival of the fittest' is a tautology. But Darwin did offer further criterion in chapter after chapter years before he acquiesced to use the phrase. Certainly Montalban has read 'Origin' since he quotes it. How is it that he missed chapter 2? How is it that he failed to understand Darwin's meaning in chapter 1? But I will concede that 'Origin' is not an easy read. Understanding requires a command of English beyond the ordinary, as well as an understanding of biological science at a graduate level. Darwin was not addressing a popular audience, even though his book became popular. Darwin was addressing the naturalist of his day - what came to be called biologists in our day. English grammar and usage has evolved since Darwin's day and biology has advanced. When one considers the importance to evolutionary theory of what Darwin said (even without the misunderstandings of the uneducated), it is a matter of historical significance only. Darwin's theories have been supported or falsified many times over. For the most part, his theories have been supported. He was wrong on some minor points.

There were many typewritters around since, according this, 1714 'The patent for the first typewritter was given to Henry Mill in 1714 but it had so many problems and was not able to be used. From there came William Burt in 1829 with the same idea to make a system of moving keys to be printed on paper; his as well was unsuccessful. Finally in 1868 with much researching and playing around with ideas of past inventors Christopher Latham Sholes invented the American typewritter. ' http://www.sunysuffolk.edu/~wooda87/aw.html",
