The last time I saw it, it said something like 'there are no half ape-half human fossils'. This is a rediculous line of thought, and shows how little you actually know about TOE.  A half ape-half human fossil would mean that an ape had reproduced with a human. THAT IS NOT WHAT THE TOE IMPLIES. I don't know how many more times you need this repeated to you, but I will offer my assistance as often as needed...no need to thank me.",
