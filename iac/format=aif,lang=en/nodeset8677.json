Hey how about Chuck Hestons speech? Some how I got the impression he gave the speech in Denver? Did you? You know the 'from my dead hands speech'. Anyhow how did Chuck Heston get to wear TWO different suits from one speech? Anyhow. If Mike Moore of Flint Michigan was behind that counter, would Mike Moore be alive? Survive with broken facial bones? Survive with internal injuries? Or overhelming beat his attacker that he survives unhurt and stopped his attacker?",
