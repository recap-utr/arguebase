Well no less bigoted than the Michael Nedows who'd cram their drivel down the throats of the majority. As to the claim on me being bigoted that is quite a stretch. I invite anyone who is unhappy with living in the greatest country on the planet who is unhappy to also feel free to emigrate. Meanwhile back at the ranch your cutcy wootcy spelling lesson falls rather flat. It doesn't negate any thing and merely shows the desperation to which you sink. I would have corrected it but then you'd accuse me of what you are guilty of so often.",
