'Between 1992 through 1998 (the last six years for which data exists), the violent crime rate in the strict and no-issue states fell 30% while the violent crime rate for states that liberalized carry laws prior to 1992 dropped half as much - by 15%. Nationally, the violent crime rate fell 25%.' http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/research/conctruth.asp",
