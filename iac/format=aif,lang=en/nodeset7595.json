      "text": "When contraception failed in my monogamous long term relationship, I heavily researched both options, as well as parenting. I looked into requirements for Medicaid, WIC, and other subsidized assistance offered in my community. I called a few clinics around town. That's an interesting story, but not for here. I had heart to heart talks to many different people with different viewpoints. I decided to have an abortion because I was sick all the time. I had diagnosed migraine headaches constantly, and my seizure disorder that had laid dormant for years returned. I couldn't leave my house. I lost my job. I was in the middle of my education (it was early summer) and if I continued my pregnancy it would have put me back a semester, thus costing thousands of dollars. The father did not want me to continue the pregnancy because he was concerned about my physical health. Just thinking about that time period makes me nauseated. I understood the merits of adoption, especially since my father was adopted. I talked to my aunt about adoption and foster care, since she has participated in both. I also thought about parenting, the love and all the things I have to offer. I knew that the father would have supported my decision to parent, I knew that our financial hardships could be dealt with, and I knew that my education could be continued later. I came to the conclusion that abortion was the best choice for me and my health. I appreciate that some may find this decision selfish, and essentially it is, since it was made with my best interests in mind. I would also hope that even if they consider it selfish, they understand the reasons why I made that decision. And if it was your wife, daughter, friend, and she was dealing with what I was, you would not expect her to continue a pregnancy.",

However, there is also that other major part of my decision - I never had the intention to become pregnant, and we even took steps to make sure I wouldn't. That also is a major factor in any of my decisions on it.  Another decision that involves my work is that from about my fifth month on (acording to the doctors I spoke with) - I would be unable to work - that's four months, and while right now I am in good standing with my company and they might even allow me to do that, back then I was just starting out, and would be unable to do so. So, I'd say that at the moment if that were to happen, and that I was paid a stipend (I know of no place near me that does so) and then gave the baby up for adoption, my fiance and I would seriously consider the prospect. I know that in the future - in five years or so - we expect to be able to have paid off all our loans, and we will then consider actually having a baby.
