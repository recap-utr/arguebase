      "text": "If only that were the case. It's pretty easy to 'shoot down' an anti, since they rarely have any kind of evidence to support their emotional claims that guns are bad. I was engaged via private message on another forum by a user (who regularly boasted of his recreational drug use) who insisted guns were bad. When challenged with stats from the British Home Office (the person in question was a Briton) he replied something along the lines of 'Well, I don't care any more'. Which I considered odd, as it was he who initiated the debate. Given that, and other comments during our brief correspondence, I concluded that he could not reconcile the stats with his stance (the fact that rape, homicide, violent assault and theft all increased while rates of firearm ownership decreased, and the police themselves were dis-armed) and simply refused to admit his position may have been poorly informed.",
