This assumption is explicitly stated on occasion, whenever 'darwinism' or evolution or some other scientific field of study is described as a 'religion'. To SS, the most unpleasant and unwelcome thing imaginable is for evidence to be presented that contradicts ones beliefs. The idea that someone could respond to an upheaval or revolution in our understanding with excitement, anticipation or delight is entirely foreign to him.",

I have never seen a direct response to this. Ever. Even in threads where the discussion has carried on in detail on both sides, this concept is totally ignored. There was a similar, brief hiatus leaning towards this point in one of the threads over at IIDB where creationist spammer Afdave is rapidly losing his dignity and proving himself predictably ignorant in all fields of science including the philosophy of same. It got really interesting for a bit and the guys over there looked to have actually got through to him for a bit, but then he predictably went into full Gish Gallop mode in order to bury his own cognitive dissonances underneath wave upon wave of standard AiG/EvoFairytale strawmen. Just my two pence; this is a fascinating psychological point that should be discussed.",
