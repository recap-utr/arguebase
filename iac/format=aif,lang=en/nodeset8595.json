Secularism does not exclude people with a religious worldview. One may imagine a devout christian that firmly believes in his faith, but is also convinced that faith must come from within and that forcing someone to behave in accordance with a religion simply encourages false faith, and would logically conclude that his faith should not be forced upon people (usually with the subclause of 'Let them burn in hell afterwards', or something else along those lines).",

I noticed this particular entry was sourced from The American Heritage\u00ae Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition so it is not something Dictionary.com wrote.  I can see Iuris' point but the entry is still laid out wrong if this is the case. As written, 'Godlessness; immorality', implies that immorality is synonymous with godlessness but the thesaurus entry for godlessness does not list immorality as a synonym. I think this is because some use the term 'godless', an adjective, to mean immoral but 'godlessness', a noun, to mean atheistic.",
