Richard Morin - Perfect 10s and the Odds of a Pink Nursery - washingtonpost.com ' 'The finger pulls the trigger,' says Leonard Berkowitz, an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin. 'But the trigger may also pull the finger. It's not just that having a gun is a convenient way of settling an argument. The weapon itself is a stimulant to violence.' 'Berkowitz has studied the 'weapons effect' for more than 40 years. 'There's no dispute,' he says. 'Even the sight of guns, which people think of as objects that can hurt others, can induce aggressive ideas. A weapon can function as a conditioned stimulus, eliciting both the thoughts and motor responses associated with its use.' ' WHY GUNS SHARE THE BLAME - TIME",

      "text": "Plenty of problems with that 'study' and parts of it are just hilarious. Number one, socialization plays a huge role in an individual's reaction to handling weapons. A teen who was raised in a family of outdoorsmen and exposed to firearms in a responsible, constructive fashion would react much differently than a teen who's only exposure to firearms is his way-cool arsenal in Call of Duty. I think that much the same results could be obtained with exchanging the 'gun' with a football. Putting a dozen or so 18-22 y.o. in a room with nothing but a football would ensure that an athletic pecking order would be established very quickly. Domineering males would be throwing the football around in a competitive, even punishing fashion, submissive males would be cowering, hoping nobody throws the ball to them. Elevated testosterone levels would be expected in both; some from competition and some from fight / flight. . . Both groups would exhibit the 'aggressive' behavior the study offers for diametrically opposite reasons. This effect is compounded because of the anonymity; the domineering would want to prove manhood and superiority and the submissives would want to inflict revenge, . . . especially if it is on an unsuspecting non-participant. I would go so far as to hypothesize that the submissives would put more hot sauce in the water than the 'aggressive' domineering subjects. I actually laughed out loud when the overly concerned testers believed they needed to defuse the potentially deadly aggression they caused in the test subjects: 'Because of the potentially arousing nature of the experiment, we wanted to ensure that all subjects were reasonably calm when they left the lab. Therefore, all subjects next watched a relaxing video of nature scenes and classical musical. Given that subjects had been deceived, we next debriefed them, emphasizing that they should not feel badly about any aggressive behavior they exhibited.' Jezz, thanks for saving us all from wanton pellet gun caused hot sauce attacks!",
