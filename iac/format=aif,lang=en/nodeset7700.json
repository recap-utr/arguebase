'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Friday urged a U.S. court to dismiss a lawsuit by gay married couples from Massachusetts who say they were unlawfully denied federal marriage benefits. President Barack Obama won strong support from gays during his presidential campaign and has pressed for repealing the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act that bars the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages. But the gay community has been angered by the Obama administration's defense of the law in court proceedings.'Obama admin: dismiss gay couple benefits lawsuit | U.S. | Reuters Bet you anything the usual apologists here will spin it to try and find some way to still give him the benefit of the doubt.",

The VERY NEXT STATEMENT includes 'the other side of the story' Justice Department officials say they are obligated to defend federal statutes when they are challenged.Obama admin: dismiss gay couple benefits lawsuit | U.S. | Reuters Obama has already put himself on record on his stance on DOMA by VOTING AGAINST it. HE PERSONALLY supports its repeal. But HE PERSONALLY is not 'the justice department'. If a bill is made into law, elected officials can't pick and choose how to do their job and take their personal considerations into account in enforcement. I object to people taking it upon themselves to ignore the law when they are county clerks asked to perform gay marriage in areas where it is legal. When the courts ruled that Gavin Newsome's gay marriages were illegal and not binding, that was the proper ruling there too. When it comes to the justice department, it is their job to argue for the existing law. Period. I don't know why that is so difficult for some. I don't know why some pretend a refusal to violate their job position is somehow a demonstration of unmitigated support for what their job requires them to do.",
