The goal, then, is for this not to be a discussion thread but a survey of the views on abortion. So please, if you can, simply present a summary of your views and try to avoid starting a discussion by making comments about any specific person's views. I, for one, will not be responding to any comments if they do come up.",

The only possible circumstance when an abortion should be an option is when the 'LIFE' of both the mother and her unborn child is at risk. When both lives are going to be lost, it is better to save one as opposed to losing two. The holocaust on the unborn children of this country is something that we should be ashamed of as a country.",
