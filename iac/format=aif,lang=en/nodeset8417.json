      "text": "Actually, if you bothered to pay any attention whatsoever, it actually goes against your point entirely. Just because WSM and I were both in 'heterosexual' Style relationships, doesn't change the fact that both of us are indeed homosexuals and therefore proves that homosexuals do indeed have children, planned or not.  Mine too was kind of a suprise. I was on the 'pill' but was also taking antibiotics at the time and for anyone who doesn't already know, antibiotics will completely cancel out the affects of the birth control pill. I was NOT aware of this at the time and low-and-behold I ended up pregnant with my son.  p.s. just for general information, I was not taking 'the pill' for birth control reasons. Not all women who are prescribed it are even sexually active at all. The birth control pill contains synthetic or naturally dirived female hormones, which for some women aids them in attaining a more regular period. Many women atheletes are prescribed birth control because being extremely athletic can disrupt, postpone or completely do away with a woman's natural cycle. Taking birth control helps to 'normalize' female hormone levels. Such was my case.",
