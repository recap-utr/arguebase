      "text": "Switzerland is the safest country in the world to live in. It is not because it is a neutral country or anything of that sort.  I believe it is due to the fact that each male citizen is required to keep a firearm in his home.  When every male citizen of Switzerland turns 20 years old, he is issued a fully automatic assault rifle.  Every male citizen is on call to defend his homeland if his country calls on him. The Swiss people and firearms go together like peanut butter and jelly. Olympic-style target shooting is Switzerland's national sport and it is not uncommon at all to see a regular citizen on a train, bus, or just walking down the street with a rifle slung over his shoulder. In Switzerland, there is less than one homicide for every 100,000 citizens each year, and in 99 percent of the cases, a firearm is never involved.  There are a mere 26 robbery attempts each year for every 100,000 citizens. The majority of these robberies are committed by foreigners and do not involve firearms. Violent crimes are virtually nonexistent, yet every home has a firearm in it. Surprised? http://www.courierpress.com/news/2010/jan/03/the-swiss-have-the-right-idea-about-firearms/emoticon_xhoho",
