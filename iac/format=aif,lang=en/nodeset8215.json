The funny thing is, you can't figure out it's satire. What is even funnier is that you appear to think that the arguments Edward Current gives are actually good and prove that atheists are deluded. He uses so many fallacies including circular reasoning and you can't seem to notice that those methods of argumentation are extremely poor.  But then again, you seem to think that Co2 is the primary input gas for ATP production rather then O2.... I'm still waiting for your equations proving that ATP production is massively higher with Co2 rather then O2.",
