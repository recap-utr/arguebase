      "text": "As for procedures such as partial birth abortion and other attempts by the far-right to limit third term abortion, my understanding (and granted this is from word of mouth only) is that the legislation proposed was too general and purposely included language that opened judicial paths toward banning all abortions. For an example of this type of manipulation of law, if, in the murder of a pregnant woman, a law is introduced in which the killing of her fetus is also considered a murder (making it a double murder), that opens judicial paths to counting the fetus (at any stage) as having the same rights against being killed as any other person. Legislators and judges alike are wary of the slippery slope and do pay attention to such intentional manipulations.",

      "text": "Just a couple of points: First, I believe your characterization that it is the far-right that is seeking to limit third-term abortions is incorrect. There seems to be large support on these forums from both the pro-choice and the pro-life side regarding third trimester abortions. Likewise, the general public seems to have been so upset with the Supreme Courts decision in Stenburg that Congress stepped in and passed a nearly identical statute to the Nebraska law. That statute cleared the Senate with the support of 16 Democrats, and it cleared the House with the support of 63 Democrats. That is not to ignore the fact that it is largely Republicans that would go further than third trimester restrictions. I am merely trying to point out that Roe stands in the way of restrictions that we all support (third trimester), and thus we all should hope for legal reform in this area. Secondly, the slippery slope argument is common, and I will address it in more detail later. My basic point is that if we really do think that third trimester fetuses have a significant moral status (and I take people at their word on this), than we should work to reform abortion laws in the United States. And that reform, as I am trying to argue, must begin with the undermining of Roe v. Wade. Note that I have not yet discussed whether Roe v. Wade should be overturned. I do plan on discussing the legal issues with this case. But as of now, I am only trying to lay some groundwork for why that discussion is so important. A lot of people that I speak with seem to think the law is so technical that it cannot be understood (or is too hard to be understood), and thus they would rather not bother with it. So, I am trying to address that. And I am doing so by simply saying 'If one seriously wishes to restrict abortion in the third trimester (which virtually everyone seems to), than one must seriously consider the legal aspects of the issue.'",
