I was told by Rev. Tristan NOT to bring most of our resources on homosexuality, for going through the Canadian border, they might get seized and I could possibly be denied entry into Canada. I was able to bring several hundred of SBM's tracts for the attendees, 'I Was Gay' and 'The Traditional American Family.'",

You have no ground anymore to say anything about anyone saying anything hateful, or commenting on the credibility of others. It's interesting that when some of you decide to attack the messenger, you assume it will automatically discount the message. No one ever said every single thing a speaker says has to be agreed with; it's part of dealing with issues to agree with some things and not others. Certainly I don't agree with everything Bennett said, but some of it needs to be repeated. Based on what I've seen and continue to see in the gay 'rights' movement, he's more on target about quite a few things than most of you would ever admit.",
