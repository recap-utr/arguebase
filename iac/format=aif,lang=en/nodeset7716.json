How could they possibly construct a human phylogenetic tree if traits are modified by enviornment, not dictated by randomly mutating genes?

Put your money where your mouth is, bub: Invest in a pedigreed Great Dane and a pedigreed Chihuahua. Breed them each to a pedigreed member of the same breed (i.e. GD \u00d7 GD and Chihuahua \u00d7 Chihuahuah, not inter-breed mating). Raise them in identical environments. According to you, all the offspring should have the same phenotype. Publish your results. You'll be rich. Go ahead. It should only take a few months. Again, you'll be rich.

One's race is not determined by a single gene or gene cluster, as is, for example, sickle cell anemia. Nor are races marked by important differences in gene frequencies, the rates of appearance of certain gene types. The data compiled by various scientists demonstrates, contrary to popular opinion, that intra-group differences exceed inter-group differences. That is, greater genetic variation exists within the populations typically labeled Black and White than between these populations. This finding refutes the supposition that racial divisions reflect fundamental genetic differences.  Along the way, various minds tried to fashion practical human typologies along the following physical axes: skin color, hair texture, facial angle, jaw size, cranial capacity, brain mass, frontal lobe mass, brain surface fissures and convolutions, and even body lice. As one scholar notes, '[t]he nineteenth century was a period of exhaustive and--as it turned out--futile search for criteria to define and describe race differences.'. . . Attempts to define racial categories by physical attributes ultimately failed. By 1871, some leading intellectuals had recognized that even using the word 'race' 'was virtually a confession of ignorance or evil intent.' The genetic studies of the last few decades have only added more nails to the coffin of biological race. Evidence shows that those features usually coded to race, for example, stature, skin color, hair texture, and facial structure, do not correlate strongly with genetic variation",
