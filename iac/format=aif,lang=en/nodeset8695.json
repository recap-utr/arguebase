In my line of reasoning, I believe since criminals are obviously using firearms, the refusal to allow lawful citizens the same means of defense is unreasonable and unfair. Good people are required to 'bring a knife to a gunfight'. (i.e. disproportionate response) While I believe that any law abiding citizen should be able to have access to the means to defend themselves, I think a reasonable compromise is possible between our two sides. How's this:  Instead of a complete ban, you concede that civilian gun ownership is a good thing and allow the reasonable ownership of handguns for personal protection. Instead of lassiz' faire 'guns for all who want them', I'll concede that a strict regimen of licencing and training/qualification for those who wish to purchase. (In the U.K. Although this is reasonable, I'm not going for it in the U.S. This would be a HUGE concession to government control here.) A strict licencing/registration scheme would be allowing for MORE freedom in the U.K. It would be tightening a 'Nazi-like' noose around our necks here in the U.S. If you are being burned at the stake, lethal injection sounds like a wonderful alternative. If you are walking down the sidewalk, it's not quite as peachy.",
