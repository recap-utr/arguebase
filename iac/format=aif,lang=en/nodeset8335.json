It was only because my own mother objected to me doing so that I stopped. Babies look like babies, not like boys or girls. It makes sense to refer to them as 'it'. It also saves strangers getting embarrased when they guess the gender wrongly. Refer to babies as 'it': it isn't disrespectful and it's sensible.",
