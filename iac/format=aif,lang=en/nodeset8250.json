Are the creationists trying to disprove the current theory of evolution, or are they trying to win converts? Also, why do you believe what you do about the universe? ('The other side is wrong' isn't the real reason you to believe what you do, I would think) Here are my answers: I am here because I enjoy debates, and I am trying to defend evolution from people who don't understand it. I believe that there is no god because I see no compelling evidence. I was brought up without anyone telling me what to believe, though I went to church occasionally. I also read the bible, but this failed to convince me. Finally, I wonder why the bible has convinced some but not others. I hope this thread proves informative.",

Yes. :)   I can only speak for myself - winning converts is what the Bible suggests, but I don't believe in doing it in a forceable way. I don't believe one person / one event wins a convert all at once, it takes a combination of many tiny little steps (examples) to win converts.  My main reason for posting here is political. I don't believe it's possible to have neutrality in government. If church & state are separated, atheism and state are combined. Atheism almost always equals secular 'progression', and Judeo Christianity almost always equals tradition, according to unchanging Biblical morals. The two quickly clash in politics. Also, I don't believe future generations (school children) are having the gaps in godless evolution explained to them clearly enough.   I enjoy written debates very much, and I'm trying to show how evolution can establish atheism in the U.S. government, in violation of the text of the First Amendment and intent of the framers.   I believe there has to be a God because I see no compelling evidence that life spontaneously generated from non living chemicals.  I was brought up without anyone forcing me what to believe, and went to church occasionally. My church attendance didn't get very regular until my late twenties - about twenty years ago. A few Bible studies, comparing it to the flow of events, the nature of people, my shortcomings, the shortcomings of science etc, convinced me.
