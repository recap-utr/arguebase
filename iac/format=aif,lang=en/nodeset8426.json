This post will tie everything together and will make more logical sense than any conveluted-writing Darwinist author (Dawkins, Mayr, Eldredge and Darwin himself) could ever dream of presenting.

The fossil record also shows that homo erectus and homo habilis lived side-by-side for a half a million years (evolutinists time clock). Therefore common sense says that homo erectus (human) could never have evolved from homo habilis (monkey). Not only that, but the fossil record shows that homo erectus lived alongside homo sapiens for 2 million years. Thus, there is no possible way that there was any evolution via random mutations and natural selection could have occurred.",
