The United States stands alone, at present, among westernized nations, in not guaranteeing health care, and therefore, the only truly democratic nation left on the planet! At the next teabagging party, they should carry signs of the leaders of all the westernized nations, including the U.S. President, with tiny moustaches. Israel is reputed to have an excellent health care system, and ranks 28th, internationally. See this tape of an anti-semitic woman pathetically shouting 'Heil Hitler' to an Israeli man speaking highly of Israel's national health system. Woman Shouts 'Heil Hitler!' At Jewish Man Praising Israel's National Health System (VIDEO)",
