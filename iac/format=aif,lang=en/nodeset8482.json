      "text": "Licensing systems are very expensive to administer. Canada's experience with its full licensing and registration system, begun in December 1998, is not encouraging. The government originally estimated that the cost of licensing Canada's three million gun owners and registering their seven million guns would be $185 million [Canadian] over five years including a one-time start-up cost of $85 million [Canadian]. But, by March 2000 the Canadian Firearms Centre admitted that the system had already cost Canadian taxpayers $327 million [Canadian] and was running up an annual bill nearly 10 times higher than the government's original forecast. The March announcement also revealed that although 270,000 valid licenses existed from the country's earlier gun control system, only 142,000 new licenses had been issued. Using these figures as a baseline for America's arsenal of 65 million handguns, the estimated cost of such a system here is staggering. Most importantly, licensing and registration in America would have little effect on the vast majority of gun violence, such as unintentional gunshot deaths, suicides and the majority of homicides, since most homicides are the result of arguments between people who know each other and who purchase guns legally. From a political perspective, a battle over licensing and registration brings every gun owner into the fray. The NRA argument that licensing and registration is the first step towards gun confiscation has always been very persuasive with gun owners. In contrast, health and safety regulation of the industry focuses on the conduct of firearm manufacturers.  Advocates of licensing and registration often cite automobiles as an example of the value of licensing and registration: we register automobiles and license drivers, so why not guns? However, licensing and registration-the primary purpose of which was to enforce a system of taxation-had virtually no effect on automobile death and injury. It was not until the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration was established in the 1960s, and changes were forced in automobile design and the driving environment, that decreases were seen.",

Like every other gun banner, she apparently sees the solution to gun crimes as taking guns away from the people who didn't commit the crime in the first place. ABC didn't stop there. Yesterday morning on 'Good Morning America,' reporter David Muir continued the agenda-based 'reporting' by proffering Michael Wolkowitz, a board member of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, as an expert on firearms without bothering to mention that he was basing his whole argument on propaganda.  In neither segment did ABC present the opposing viewpoint, choosing instead to promote their own biased agenda, including promoting yet another anti-gun piece they are planning to air this Friday entitled, 'If I Only Had a Gun,' which Sawyer noted included a segment highlighting that 'since there is an impulse to think if I had a gun I could protect myself and others, we have an experience we'll conduct based on a real incident in which we show you what happens.' I'm sure that reenactment will be completely unbiased and realistic, right?",
