Officers and medics responded to the scene, in the 1600 block of 33rd Street SE in Auburn, at about 1 a.m. after receiving a 911 call about shots fired in the area. As police swooped in, they spotted two vehicles fleeing the scene with their lights out. .... The shooting victims - two women and one man in their late teens or early 20s - are being treated at Auburn General Hospital and Harborview Medical Center. All have serious injuries. The identities of the victims and suspects were not immediately released. A report from Valley Regional Fire Authority said one of the gunshot victims may be pregnant. The shooting incident remains under investigation. No motive has yet been established.",
