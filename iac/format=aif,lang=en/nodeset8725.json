Many on the liberal front often tell us that the police are there for the purpose of protecting us, that they'll keep us safe, that we don't need a gun if we just call 911 and let the police handle it, etc. Well a lot of good that advice is gonna do these South Carolina people, now that the police have been ordered not to pursue criminals who run from the scene of a crime. If they start hopping fences then the police can't pursue in their squad cars, and they can't get out to chase after them either. So...even before, the courts have stated explicitly that the job of the police is not to protect anyone, and now we have mayors ordering the police to not apprehend fleeing criminals. This means that those townspeople are gonna need to rely on themselves. And if the gun control laws are liberal and excessively strict, they're SOL. Innocent people are gonna get getting killed because of this new policy.",
