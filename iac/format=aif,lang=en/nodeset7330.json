      "text": "yea...it's like ordering a pizza. First the paleontologist digs up a bone or other artifact...then he calls the lab, tells them what he found and gives them the date they can expect the bone to arrive for 'testing.' Then the lab asks him from what organism the bone once belonged and also what toppings, I mean dates, he wants for his bone. Then the paleontologist gives him the range of dates that most suit his presuppositions.....Then the paleontologists sends in the bone fed-ex, along with a gift-certificate to the finest steakhouse in town and two tickets to the ballgame, and then sits back and waits for the results. Finally, just to be on the safe side, the paleontologist repeats this scenario with at least 2 more labs...this way just in case one doesn't cooperate he has backup and he can pick a date from any number of labs.",
