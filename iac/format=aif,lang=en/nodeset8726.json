Likewise I believe God made it so peppered moths are able to modify their wing-patterns based on environment or background colors. This is no more unbelievable than the fact that a fish can change colors or that a snail can grow a bigger shell in the presence of predators. It all comes from the same creative Designer. And what's funny is evolutionists - in one breath - will tell you how they do not deny plasticity....yet in the next breath will tell you that's not how finches and moths changed! If these people were intellectually honest, they wouldn't talk out of both side of their mouths like that...they would admit the truth. But I no longer expect the truth out of atheists.",

Now, my body, in the precence of foreign organisms, will create brand new protiens designed to kill the invaders, but this is a simple genetic process well understood by biologists. I still ask you to show me some study where an animal has been placed in an altered environment and makes a larger beak, grows extra limbs, etc. The problem with your fish and moth examples are growing larger shells or changing colors are abilities, not permanent changes, that are shared by the organism's offspring. If a snail grew a large shell when there were many predators around, its offspring would not have the same large shells unless a similar predator threat existed. You're arguements about plasticity essentially claim the story of how the elephant got its trunk is a valid evolutionary theory.",

It's another two-way street that evolutionists have chosen to completely abandon because of their head-in-the-sand version of science which validates their atheist agenda.  But see I have a theory as to why science must do this: It's because science has come to realization that all animals have brains and consciousness in varying forms. These, of course, are the anti-science because science cannot explain such a phenomenon. But the fact is each animal has it's own brain - and each brain comes pre-programmed with its own abilities according to how God designed it. Each animal has a different function and different abilities. God knew beforehand that environmental circumstances would be changing, thus he gave each organism the ability to change with it.

Your first assirtion is wrong because some organisms, like sponges and jellyfish, do not require a centralized nervous system. Your second assertion is nonesensical and incorrect according to classic Christion dogma. You have no definition for consiousness so potentially even plants have some, making your assertion meaningless. Animals would all have enough consiousness to do what they needed to fill their niche, and this would be caused by slow natural selection, not by holy edict. By the way, most pastors I'm familiar with would tell you animals don't go to heaven because they are both soulless and lack conscious thought. As to you stating God gave animals the ability to change to their environment, do you have evidence of massive bodily changes? Tell your assertion to the millions upon millions of species that have gone extint in Earth's history because of changing enviroments or more powerful competition.",

You're arguement that the brain is a fundamental unit of life is just plain wrong, considering the majority of all organisms don't have one.

Brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken. Some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex.  Your arguements all show a general lack of study in biology and my common sense is appalled by yours.

It is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science. The simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made. A similar turn has occured in chemistry. I could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions. All the research now is about electron orbitals and nano-structures. The reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them. I myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes.

However, you didn't just look at the 'miraculous creation,' no you had a study guide. Allow me to mention something right here, and point out I'm a Methodist....ahem THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN BY MEN. Arguing that the events in the bible happened or not is a different issue, but God did not give us a master copy of the bible and tell us to copy it. Biblical scholars have noted that the bible is an amalgam of different authors who had different outlooks on God. The bible is an excellent source of faith and guidance, it is not an infallible work and does not answer all questions. As to your second point, argueing that liberals wish to analyze porn and worship death just shows you haven't really put much thought into this contention. You are right that the government has removed references to Christianity in its subsidiaries like public school. There is a good reason for this. I can't for the life of me recall where this quote is from but it said: 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.'  This means government isn't suppose to support religious groups. What would you define mandatory school prayer as? Anyone who has ever argued that a seperation between church and state isn't a good thing has obviously never been the religious minority.
