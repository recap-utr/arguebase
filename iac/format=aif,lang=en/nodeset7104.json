Conceptually, it is conceived that present tense of this conception is to conceive a child. I am curious as to know whether or not conceive and concept are participles or perhaps conjugations of a single word or are they two different words used interchangably. I am doubly curious to know as to how pregnancy came about as being conceived as conceptual?",

Perhaps you need a little insight into how your perceptions might alter your concept..... but insight is one thing I can not give you much to my dismay",
