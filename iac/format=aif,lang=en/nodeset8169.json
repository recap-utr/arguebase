      "text": "Here is the link to the report Brady mentions: http://www.bradycampaign.org/xshare/reports/fedleg/obama-1styear-report.pdfBrady I'm sorry, Brady, that you feel Obama has betrayed you by supporting (or at least not opposing) a few gun owner friendly initiatives. And here I thought this was supposed to be change you could believe in. Have you ever thought to consider he does so because he thinks it is the right thing to do? Are you willing to consider his motives and give him the benefit of the doubt? Probably not. You probably think he is just afraid to upset gun owners. And there is probably some truth in this. Based upon his past rhetoric I do not doubt that Obama would push gun control if he thought he could. But you have to look at things from his perspective-a 'what is best for me as politician' viewpoint.  You have only yourself to blame if you're disappointed in Obama. It was you and people like you at the BC who placed such unrealistic hopes in him without considering how little he needed your support. Guns were not an issue in his election, and contrary to whatever you might believe he does not owe his position to the support of the BC. Really now, with everything else he is trying to accomplish, what do the complaints of a fringe anti-gun group with limited membership matter to him? It's not like you and the other BC supporters are going to vote for Sarah Palin in the next election. At worst, Obama knows you could grow petulant and boycott him by refusing to vote at all in the next election. But he can calculate how few votes he would really loose.  Look at it from his perspective, Brady. The BC competes directly with the NRA. Both organizations make their own arguments, use their own rhetoric, cite their own statistics and studies, and yet it is the NRA which dominates with membership. The bottom line is the NRA and BC have for years gone head to head in the free marketplace of ideas, and the BC has lost. It is the NRA which has several million members, not the BC. And, in addition to normal membership fundraising there are hundreds of non-profit tax-exempt Friends of the National Rifle Association fundraising committees nationwide. Friends of NRA, National Rifle Association of America Each one is a local grassroots organization made up of volunteer community business and social leaders, and each one hosts an annual banquet to raise money which is spent back in the local community-primarily for youth shooting sports and education to ensure the future of responsible gun ownership in America. The BC has no way to challenge this kind of grassroots power. The NRA offers a positive message to its members. You have the right to keep and bear arms. You can be trusted to make decisions about the security of yourself and your family. Punish the criminal, and leave the law abiding alone. The NRA dominates the political landscape because, like AARP, this message attracts millions of members. People who are willing to donate their time, their money, and cast their votes to support the RKBA. People like me, Brady, who have done more to fight gun crime this month than you have done in your entire life.  Look at it from Obama's perspective, Brady. What does the BC offer to oppose this? It peddles fear. It offers tired complaints about how people cannot be trusted to care for themselves. It takes hypocritical positions which undermine its credibility. For example, it claimed the NRA's 'Eddie Eagle' program message was ineffective, and then it decided to sell the exact same message under its own name. http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/12966-chilling-resemblance-between-north-korean-indoctrination-eddie-eagle-program.html#post360048 It still offers a re-tread of a failed 'assault weapons ban'-despite knowing it was a failure. And it has supporters like you, Brady-people who want the failed AW Ban back so bad they are willing to make up a lie to sell it to us, only to run away and hide when you got caught lying: http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/11381-rise-police-deaths-because-no-ban-assault-weapons.html No, I haven't forgotten that one.  Brady, you cannot expect Obama to waste political capital fighting against such a large number of gun owning voters over ideas so bankrupt you must make up lies to support them. And don't call him a traitor when you know you've given him no cause to feel confident in your own support of him. If he took on gun owners, then do you really think he can rely upon the support of someone like you who lies and then runs away at the first sign of a challenge? If you really want his support, then first offer him something he can actually sell to the public with a straight face and then give him some assurance you won't run away at the first sign of trouble.",
