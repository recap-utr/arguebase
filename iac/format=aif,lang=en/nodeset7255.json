      "text": "'It seems to me that with all the mortals throughout the world, including the Pope, praying fervently for the life of Terri Schiavo to be saved, the Bible God, to whom they were praying, should have intervened. ... ... For instance in Matthew 21:21-22, the author quotes Jesus, aka God, as saying, 'I tell you the truth ... If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.' Then in Mark 11:23-24, the author quotes Jesus again saying, 'I tell you the truth, ... whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.' If those quotes were correct and Jesus, aka God, was telling the truth, it begs a very important question: was not a single one of those who prayed worthy of having his or her prayer answered? It's frightening to think the Pope would not be considered worthy enough to have his prayers answered, but apparently, according to Jesus, aka God, and providing the quotes were translated correctly, he was not.'
