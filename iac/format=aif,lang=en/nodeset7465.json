I think the decision should be up to the woman, as under U.S. law. Between her and her doctor, whoever else she freely chooses to share with. I think, at some point, in a normally developing pregnancy, a very fuzzy looking line is crossed. But that's why we have state regulations during the third trimester. IMO, Latin American countries, until this day, are unduly under the influence of the Church, superstition and ignorance.",
