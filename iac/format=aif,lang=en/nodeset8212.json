Even if she does not have to raise the child, it does not mean she is emotionally, mentally, physically, or economically able to support a pregnancy. I have frequently suggested finding ways of bringing abortion down by addressing these issues - but according the lifers around here these problems don't exist and all that needs to be done is taking punitive measures against women. But then - when they take that stance they really do lose all credibility. At least for me. Wouldn't leave my kid alone with someone who loves like that.",
