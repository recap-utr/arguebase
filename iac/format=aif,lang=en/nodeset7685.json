'He claims justification,' Kim Parker, a prosecutor said, calling on jurors here to uphold the law, not Mr. Roeder's views of abortion, which, she said, he had proudly trumpeted on the witness stand. 'These are not the acts of a justified man. These acts are cowardly.'  .... Yes, he bought a gun. Yes, he took target practice. Yes, he had learned about Dr. Tiller's habits, his home address, his security precautions. And, yes, he shot Dr. Tiller last May 31 as Dr. Tiller stood inside his church. 'That is correct, yes,' Mr. Roeder told the jurors, in a calm.",
