When you were a child, and had total awe of your parents, and believed what they told you, were you less of a person then? Surely you understand that what your parents taught you then, was a part of you growining and becoming an adult. God for instance calls Himself 'Father'. This isn't because He has 'male sex organs' but because it is the best way for us to understand His relationship to us. Likewise, the Jews made laws in order to best live according to God's Will. They did make mistakes, and got bogged down in the law. Jesus came (as promised by God) and liberated us from the entrapment we had set for ourselves.  Surely you don't advocate that we should return to a strict observence of Mosaic laws?",
