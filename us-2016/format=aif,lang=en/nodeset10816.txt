COOPER: Thank you. <br>CLINTON: ...not taking a back seat to anybody on my values... <br>COOPER: Thank... <br>CLINTON: ...my principles and the results that I get. <br>COOPER: Senator Sanders... [applause] <br>Senator Sanders, <span class="highlighted" id="node1">in 2008, congressional leaders were told, without the 2008 bailout, the U.S. was possibly days away from a complete meltdown</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node6">Despite that, you still voted against it</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node11">As president, would you stand by your principles if it risked the country's financial stability</span>? <br>SANDERS: Well, <span class="highlighted" id="node20">I remember that meeting very well</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node29"> I remember it like it was yesterday</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node40">Hank Paulson, Bernanke came in</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node47"><span class="highlighted" id="node48">they say, "guys, the economy is going to collapse because Wall Street is going under. It's gonna take the economy with them</span></span>." <br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node59">you know what I said to Hank Paulson</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node66">I said, "Hank, your guys — you come from Goldman Sachs. Your millionaire and billionaire friends caused this problem</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node84">How about your millionaire and billionaire friends paying for the bailout, not working families in this country</span>?" <br>So to answer your question,<span class="highlighted" id="node137"> no, I would not have let the economy collapse</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node144">it was wrong to ask the middle class to bail out Wall Street</span>. And by the way,<span class="highlighted" id="node132"> I want Wall Street now to help kids in this country go to college, public colleges and universities, free with a Wall Street speculation tax</span>. [applause] <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node120">We're going to talk about that in a minute</span>. <br>But, <span class="highlighted" id="node127">Senator Webb, I want to get you in</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node161">You have said neither party has the guts to take on Wall Street</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node172">Is the system rigged</span>? <br>WEBB: <span class="highlighted" id="node179">There is a reality that I think we all need to recognize with respect to the power of the financial sector</span>. <br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node186">let me just go back a minute and say that on this TARP program, I introduced a piece of legislation calling for a windfall profits tax on the executives of any of these companies that got more than $5 billion, that it was time for them, once they got their compensation and their bonus, to split the rest of the money they made with the nurses and the truck drivers and the soldiers who bailed them out</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node191"> With respect to the financial sector, I mean, I know that my time has run out but in speaking of changing positions and the position on how this debate has occurred is kind of frustrating</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node198">unless somebody mentions my name I can't get into the discussion</span>. <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node222">You agreed to these rules</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node227">you're wasting time</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node217">if you would finish your answer, we'll move on</span>. <br>WEBB: All right. Well, <span class="highlighted" id="node248">I'm trying to set a mark here</span> so <span class="highlighted" id="node253">maybe we can get into a little more later on</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node258"> This hasn't been equal time</span>. <br>But <span class="highlighted" id="node281">if you want to look at what has happened, if we look at the facts in terms of how we're going to deal with this, since that crash, in the last 10 years, the amount of the world's capital economy that Wall Street manages has gone from 44 percent to 55 percent</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node288">That means the Wall Street money managers are not risking themselves as the same way the American people are when they're going to get their compensation</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node299">They're managing money from all over the world</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node310">We have to take that into consideration when we're looking at ways to regulate it</span>. <br>COOPER: Governor Chafee,<span class="highlighted" id="node317"> you have attacked Secretary Clinton for being too close to Wall Street banks</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node324">In 1999 you voted for the very bill that made banks bigger</span>. <br>CHAFEE: <span class="highlighted" id="node331">The Glass-Steagall was my very first vote</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node338">I'd just arrived</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node349"> my dad had died in office</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node356">I was appointed to the office</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node363">it was my very first vote</span>. <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node374">Are you saying you didn't know what you were voting for</span>? <br>CHAFEE: <span class="highlighted" id="node381"><span class="highlighted" id="node382">I'd just arrived at the Senate</span></span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node387">I think we'd get some takeovers, and that was one</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node392">It was my very first vote, and it was 92-5</span>. It was the... <br>COOPER: Well, with all due respect, Governor... <div>CHAFEE: But let me just say... </div><div>COOPER: ... <span class="highlighted" id="node418">what does that say about you that you're casting a vote for something you weren't really sure about</span>? <br>CHAFEE: I think <span class="highlighted" id="node425">you're being a little rough</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node430">I'd just arrived at the United States Senate</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node435">I'd been mayor of my city</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node440">My dad had died</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node445">I'd been appointed by the governor</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node450">It was the first vote and it was 90-5</span>, because<span class="highlighted" id="node455"> it was a conference report</span>. <br>But <span class="highlighted" id="node495">let me just say about income inequality</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node500">We've had a lot of talk over the last few minutes, hours, or tens of minutes, but no one is saying how we're going to fix it</span>. And<span class="highlighted" id="node505"> it all started with the Bush tax cuts that favored the wealthy</span>. <br>So<span class="highlighted" id="node516"> let's go back to the tax code</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node527">0.6 percent of Americans are at the top echelon, over 464,000, 0.6 Americans. That's less than 1 percent</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node532">they generate 30 percent of the revenue</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node582">they're doing fine</span>. <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node542">Thank you, Governor</span>. <br>CHAFEE: So <span class="highlighted" id="node547">there's still a lot more money to be had from this top echelon</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node552">I'm saying let's have another tier and put that back into the tax bracket</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node557">that will generate $42 billion</span>. <br>COOPER:<span class="highlighted" id="node562"> I want to bring in Dana Bash</span>. <br>CHAFEE: And <span class="highlighted" id="node567">then we can help the middle class and hard-earning Americans — hard-working Americans</span>. <br><br></div>
