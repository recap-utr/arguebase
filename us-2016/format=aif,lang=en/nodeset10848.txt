CLINTON: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node6">It's a beautiful facility</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node13">It immediately was put to use</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node20">you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do</span>...<div><br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node27">Maybe he didn't do a good job</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node34">I was unsatisfied with his work</span>...<br><br></div><div>CLINTON: Well, to...</div><div><br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node41">Which our country should do, too</span>.<br><br></div><div>CLINTON: <span class="highlighted" id="node48">Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?</span><br><span class="highlighted" id="node55">I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node62">He provided a good middle-class life for us</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node69">the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides</span>.<br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node76"><span class="highlighted" id="node77">when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times</span></span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node100">There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node109">You call yourself the King of Debt</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node116">You talk about leverage</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node121">You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States</span>.<br><br></div><div>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node136">Wrong. Wrong</span>.<br><br></div><div>CLINTON: Well, <span class="highlighted" id="node147">sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node158">sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government</span>.<br><br></div><div>HOLT: Let's let Mr. Trump...<br><br></div><div>CLINTON: And <span class="highlighted" id="node165">we need to be very clear about that</span>.<br><br></div><div>TRUMP: So, yeah, I thinkâ€”<span class="highlighted" id="node172">I do think it's time</span>. Look, <span class="highlighted" id="node179">it's all words</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node186">it's all sound bites</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node193">I built an unbelievable company</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node200">Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node211">real estate assets anywhere in the world</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node222">beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node234">It's an unbelievable company</span>.<br>But <span class="highlighted" id="node247">on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node254">when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation</span>.<br>Now, <span class="highlighted" id="node265">if you want to change the laws, <span class="highlighted" id="node270">you've been there a long time,</span> change the laws</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node283">I take advantage of the laws of the nation</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node290">I'm running a company</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node297">My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node310">that's what I do</span>.<br>But <span class="highlighted" id="node317">what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are <span class="highlighted" id="node338">unbelievably</span> happy and that love me</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node324">I'll give you an example</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node331">We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House</span>, so <span class="highlighted" id="node339">if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another</span>.<br>But <span class="highlighted" id="node350">we're opening the Old Post Office</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node357">Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node364">I'm a year ahead of schedule</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node371"><span class="highlighted" id="node376">that's what this country should be doing</span></span>.<br><span class="highlighted" id="node383">We build roads</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node390">they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node397">We buy products for our military</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node404">they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node411">we don't have people that know what they're doing</span>.<br><span class="highlighted" id="node422">When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node429">we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node440">The Trump International is way under budget</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node447">way ahead of schedule</span>.
