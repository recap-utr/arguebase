 development<br>
  helloboots: <span class="highlighted" id="node248">Gob stands for George-Oscar Bluth, no</span>?<br>
  ThE_CoMpOsR: Makes sense, since <span class="highlighted" id="node259">Jeb is actually his initials John Ellis
 Bush</span><br>
  JGT3000: Pretty sure <span class="highlighted" id="node282">that's where the inspiration for Gob's name came

  That's exactly what it is. <span class="highlighted" id="node296">GOB stands for George Oscar Bluth and Jeb is for
 John Ellis Bush</span>.<br>
  fredfredburger0123: I think <span class="highlighted" id="node311">he's referring to the fact that no one is
 giving him credit just for being a bush</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node316">They don't call him governor bush,

 brother</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node394">What he was trying to articulate (not so eloquently) is that in
 Florida, he's earned the right to not be lumped in the same category as his
 brother</span>.<br>

 Because <span class="highlighted" id="node427">I earned it</span>."<br>
  rhomphaia: Lol, <span class="highlighted" id="node464">was confused at first, too</span>. Pretty sure <span class="highlighted" id="node469">he was saying he
