And <span class="highlighted" id="node119">they are saying , hey , we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node134">I do n't think top-down works in America</span> . I think <span class="highlighted" id="node141">building the middle class , investing in the middle class , making college debt-free so more young people can get their education , helping people refinance their—their debt from college at a lower rate</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node148">Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node163">Broad-based , inclusive growth is what we need in America , not more advantages for people at the very top</span>.<br><br>HOLT : Mr. Trump , we 're ... <br><br>TRUMP : <span class="highlighted" id="node180">Typical politician</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node187">All talk , no action</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node198">Sounds good , does n't work</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node215">Never going to happen</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node226">Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what 's going on</span>.Now , look , <span class="highlighted" id="node233">we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node240">believe me : We 're in a bubble right now</span> .
