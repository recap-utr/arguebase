KELLY: It's just before 10:00 p.m. on the East Coast. Welcome back to Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, and the very first Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential campaign. Ten candidates on the stage, selected based on their standing in five national polls. And tonight they are facing off, answering the questions you want asked. We hope. [laughter] <br><br>WALLACE: Gentlemen, we're obviously digging into some subjects in depth, but we're also going to change it up every once in a while throughout the next hour and have many rounds where we ask, you are not going to like it, only a couple of candidates questions on those subjects. This is the first of the many rounds, and it's about somebody whose name probably hasn't been mentioned enough so far tonight. <br>Governor Kasich, let me start with you. Whoever the Republican nominee -- [applause] <br><span class="highlighted" id="node1">Whoever the Republican nominee is, it looks at least for now like whoever that nominee is, he or she, will be facing off against Hillary Clinton</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node6">You know how she will come after whoever the Republican nominee is</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node13">She will say that you, whoever it is, support the rich while she supports the middle class</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node20">That you want to suppress the rights of women and minorities</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node27">She wants to move the country forward while you, the Republicans, want to take the country back to the past</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node34">How will you, if you're the nominee, how will you answer that and take Hillary Clinton on?</span> <br><br>KASICH: <span class="highlighted" id="node41">Let's start off with my father being a mailman</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node48">I understand the concerns of all the folks across this country, some of whom have trouble, you know, making ends meet</span>. But I think <span class="highlighted" id="node55">she will come in a narrow way</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node62">The nominee of this party, if they're going to win, has got to come at it in a big way, which is pro-growth</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node69">Which is balancing budgets</span>. You know, <span class="highlighted" id="node76">we were talking about it</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node83"><span class="highlighted" id="node90">People were saying, could we do it<span class="highlighted hlcurrent" id="node282">?</span></span></span> <span class="highlighted" id="node91">I was the chairman of the Budget Committee and the lead architect the last time it happened in Washington</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node98">when we did it we had great economic growth, we cut taxes, and we had a big surplus</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node103">Economic growth is the key</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node134">Economic growth is the key to everything</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node123">once you have economic growth, it is important that we reach out to people who live in the shadows, the people who don't seem to ever think that they get a fair deal</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node129">that includes people in our minority community</span>; <span class="highlighted" id="node141">that includes people who feel as though they don't have a chance to move up</span>. <br>You know,<span class="highlighted" id="node148"> America is a miracle country</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node155">we have to restore the sense that the "Amiracle" will apply to you</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node166">Each and every one of the people in this country who's watching tonight, lift everybody, [timer sounds] unite everybody and build a stronger United States of America again</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node173">It will be and can be done</span>. <br><br>WALLACE: I know that all of you would like to answer this question, but we're only going to ask one other candidate before we move on to a different subject, Dr. Carson. <br>Basically, same question to you. <span class="highlighted" id="node180">If Hillary Clinton is the nominee and she comes at you with that kind of line of attack, how will you take Iraq?</span><br> <br>CARSON: <span class="highlighted" id="node195">If Hillary is the candidate, <span class="highlighted" id="node202">which I doubt</span>, that would be a dream come true</span>. [laughter] <br>But you know, <span class="highlighted" id="node209">the fact of the matter is, she is the epitome of the progressive -- the secular progressive movement</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node216">she counts on the fact that people are uninformed</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node224"><span class="highlighted" id="node223">the Alinsky Model</span>, taking advantage of useful idiots</span>. <br>Well, <span class="highlighted" id="node231">I just happen to believe that people are not stupid</span>. [applause] And <span class="highlighted" id="node247">the way I will come at it is to educate people</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node254">help people to actually understand that it is that progressive movement that is causing them the problems</span>. <br>You know, <span class="highlighted" id="node261">you look at the -- the national debt and how it's being driven up</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node268">If I was trying to destroy this country, what I would do is find a way to drive wedges between all the people, drive the debt to an unsustainable level, and then step off the stage as a world leader and let our enemies increase while we decreased our capacity as a military person</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node275">that's what she's doing</span>. [applause] <br>
