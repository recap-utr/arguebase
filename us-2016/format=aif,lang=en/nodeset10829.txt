WALLACE: Gentlemen, <span class="highlighted" id="node1">we're turning to a new subject that all of you have been talking about and some of you have been disagreeing about, and that is the issue of immigration</span>. <br>Governor Bush, <span class="highlighted" id="node6">you released a new plan this week on illegal immigration focusing on enforcement, which some suggest is your effort to show that you're not soft on that issue</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node11">I want to ask you about a statement that you made last year about illegal immigrants</span>. And here's what you said. "<span class="highlighted" id="node16">They broke the law, but it's not a felony, it's an act of love</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node21">It's an act of commitment to your family</span>." <br><span class="highlighted" id="node40">Do you stand by that statement and do you stand by your support for earned legal status</span>? <br>BUSH: <span class="highlighted" id="node47">I do</span>. I believe that <span class="highlighted" id="node59">the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node64">They want to provide for their family</span>. <br>But <span class="highlighted" id="node77">we need to control our border</span>. It's not -- <span class="highlighted" id="node82">it's our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in</span>. So I -- <span class="highlighted" id="node95">I've written a book about this and yet this week, I did come up with a comprehensive strategy that -- that really mirrored what we said in the book, which is that we need to deal with E-Verify, we need to deal with people that come with a legal visa and overstay</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node106">We need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement, border security</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node111">We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node116">It is ridiculous and tragic...[applause]...that people are dying because of the fact that -- that local governments are not following the federal law</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node127">There's much to do</span>. And I think <span class="highlighted" id="node132">rather than talking about this as a wedge issue, which Barack Obama has done now for six long years, the next president -- and I hope to be that president -- will fix this once and for all so that we can turn this into a driver for high sustained economic growth</span>. <br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node137">there should be a path to earned legal status...[timer sounds] ...for those that are here</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node142">Not -- not amnesty, earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time</span>. <br>WALLACE: Thank you, sir. [applause] Mr. Trump, it has not escaped anybody's notice that you say that <span class="highlighted" id="node171">the Mexican government, the Mexican government is sending criminals -- rapists, drug dealers, across the border</span>. <br>Governor Bush has called those remarks, quote, "<span class="highlighted" id="node176">extraordinarily ugly</span>." <br><span class="highlighted" id="node197">I'd like you -- you're right next to him -- tell us -- talk to him directly and say how you respond to that</span> and -- and you have repeatedly said that <span class="highlighted" id="node216">you have evidence that the Mexican government is doing this</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node225">you have evidence you have refused or declined to share</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node211">Why not use this first Republican presidential debate to share your proof with the American people</span>? <br>TRUMP: So, <span class="highlighted" id="node246">if it weren't for me, you wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration, Chris</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node251">You wouldn't even be talking about it</span>. [applause] <span class="highlighted" id="node262">This was not a subject that was on anybody's mind until I brought it up at my announcement</span>. And I said, <span class="highlighted" id="node277">Mexico is sending</span>. Except the reporters, because <span class="highlighted" id="node284">they're a very dishonest lot, generally speaking, in the world of politics</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node289">they didn't cover my statement the way I said it</span>. <br>The fact is, <span class="highlighted" id="node294">since then, many killings ,murders, crime, drugs pouring across the border, are money going out and the drugs coming in</span>. And I said<span class="highlighted" id="node307"> we need to build a wall, and it has to be built quickly</span>. <br>And<span class="highlighted" id="node320"> I don't mind having a big beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node327">we need, Jeb, to build a wall,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node332">we need to keep illegals out</span>. [cheering and applause] <br>WALLACE: <span class="highlighted" id="node341">Mr. Trump, I'll give you 30 seconds -- I'll give you 30 seconds to answer my question</span>, which was, <span class="highlighted" id="node348">what evidence do you have, specific evidence that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border</span>? T<span class="highlighted" id="node361">hirty seconds</span>. <br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node370">Border Patrol, I was at the border last week</span>. Border Patrol, people that I deal with, that I talk to, they say <span class="highlighted" id="node395">this is what's happening</span>. Because <span class="highlighted" id="node380">our leaders are stupid</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node385">Our politicians are stupid</span>. <br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node390">the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node422">they send the bad ones over</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node427">they don't want to pay for them</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node446">They don't want to take care of them</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node462">Why should they</span> when <span class="highlighted" id="node467">the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them</span>? And <span class="highlighted" id="node484">that's what is happening whether you like it or not</span>. [cheering and applause] <br>WALLACE: <span class="highlighted" id="node499">All right</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node491">Obviously there's a lot more to talk about this</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node498"> We're going to have more questions for the candidates on illegal immigration, plus other key topics including your questions on Facebook</span>. <br>[video clip begins] <br>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: <span class="highlighted" id="node506">What will be your plan on making immigration easier for those that want to do it legally</span>? <br>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: <span class="highlighted" id="node513">What specific steps would you take to contain the growth of ISIS</span>? <br>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:<span class="highlighted" id="node518"> I'd like to know what the candidates are going to do so that I feel safe in my own country again</span>. <br>[video clip ends] <br>[commercial break] <br>
