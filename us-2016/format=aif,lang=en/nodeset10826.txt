COOPER: Secretary Clinton? <br>CLINTON: Thank you very much, Anderson. And thanks to all the viewers who tuned in tonight. <br>I think <span class="highlighted" id="node1">what you did see is that, in this debate, we tried to deal with some of the very tough issues facing our country</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node6">That's in stark contrast to the Republicans who are currently running for president</span>. <br>What you have to ask yourself is: <span class="highlighted" id="node11">Who amongst us has the vision for actually making the changes that are going to improve the lives of the American people</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node16">Who has the tenacity and the ability and the proven track record of getting that done</span>? <br>Now, <span class="highlighted" id="node21">I revere my late mother</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node26">she gave me a lot of good advice</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node31">one of the best pieces of advice she gave me was, you know, the issue is not whether or not you get knocked down</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node36">It's whether you get back up</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node41">America's been knocked down</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node46">That Great Recession, 9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million lost their homes, $13 trillion in wealth disappeared</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node51">although we've made progress, we're standing but not running the way America needs to</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node56">My mission as president will be to raise incomes for hard-working middle-class families</span> and<span class="highlighted" id="node61"> to make sure that we get back to the basic bargain I was raised with: If you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node66">Please join me in this campaign</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node71">Please come and make it clear that America's best days are still ahead</span>. Thank you very much. [applause] <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node76">Well, that does it for this Democratic presidential debate</span>. On behalf of everyone at CNN, we want to thank the candidates, our debate partners at Facebook, the Wynn Resort, and the Democratic National Committee.
