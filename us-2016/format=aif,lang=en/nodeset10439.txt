COOPER : <span id="node1" class="highlighted">Secretary Clinton , you have to be able to respond</span> .<span id="node7" class="highlighted"> He brought you up</span> . <br>CLINTON : <span id="node14" class="highlighted">Yeah</span> . You know , I — <span id="node21" class="highlighted">I respect the passion an intensity</span> . <span id="node26" class="highlighted">I represented Wall Street , as a senator from New York</span> , and <span id="node31" class="highlighted">I went to Wall Street in December of 2007 — before the big crash that we had</span> — and <span id="node36" class="highlighted">I basically said , `` cut it out ! Quit foreclosing on homes ! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors . ''</span> <span id="node45" class="highlighted">I took on the Bush administration for the same thing</span> . So <span id="node50" class="highlighted">I have thought deeply and long about what we 're gonna do to do exactly what I think both the senator and the governor want , which is to rein in and stop this risk</span> . And<span id="node55" class="highlighted"><span id="node56" class="highlighted"> my plan would have the potential of actually sending the executives to jail </span></span>. <span id="node61" class="highlighted">Nobody went to jail after $ 100 billion in fines were paid</span> and <span id="node66" class="highlighted">would give regulators the authority to go after the big banks</span> . <br>COOPER : Thank you . Thank you . Senator Sanders ... <br>CLINTON : But I 'm telling you — I will say it tonight . <span id="node71" class="highlighted">If only you look at the big banks , you may be missing the forest for the trees</span> . [ crosstalk ]<br>WEBB : Bernie , say my name so I can get into this . <br>SANDERS : I will , just a second . <br>WEBB : OK . Thank you . [ laughter ] <br>SANDERS : I 'll tell him . <span id="node88" class="highlighted"><span id="node76" class="highlighted"><span id="node77" class="highlighted">I</span>n my view , Secretary Clinton , you do not</span> </span>— <span id="node83" class="highlighted">Congress does not regulate Wall Street</span> . <span id="node93" class="highlighted">Wall Street regulates Congress</span> . [ applause ] And <span id="node98" class="highlighted">we have got ta break off these banks</span> . Going to them and <span id="node164" class="highlighted">saying , `` please , do the right thing '' is kind of naive</span>. <br>WEBB : Anderson , I need to jump in ( inaudible ) . <br>CLINTON : So<span id="node233" class="highlighted"> no , that 's not what that</span> — <span id="node177" class="highlighted">I think Dodd-Frank was a very good start</span> , and <span id="node182" class="highlighted">I think that we have to implement it</span> . <span id="node187" class="highlighted">We have to prevent the Republicans from ripping it apart</span> . <span id="node192" class="highlighted">We have to save the Consumer Financial Protection board , which is finally beginning to act to protect consumers</span> . [ applause ] <span id="node197" class="highlighted">We have work to do</span> . <span id="node250" class="highlighted">You 've got no argument from me</span> . But I know , <span id="node257" class="highlighted">if we do n't come in with a very tough and comprehensive approach , like the plan I 'm recommending</span> , <span id="node262" class="highlighted">we 're gon na be behind instead of ahead on what the next crisis could be</span> . <br>COOPER : Governor O'Malley ? Where do you stand ? <br><br>O'MALLEY : Anderson , look , this is — the big banks — I mean , <span id="node271" class="highlighted">once we repealed Glass-Steagall back in the late 1999s ( ph ) , the big banks , the six of them , went from controlling , what , the equivalent of 15 percent of our GDP to now 65 percent of our GDP</span> . And — ( inaudible )<span id="node278" class="highlighted"> right before this debate , Secretary Clinton 's campaign put out a lot of reversals on positions on Keystone and many other things</span> . But <span id="node285" class="highlighted">one of them that we still have a great difference on , Madam Secretary , is that you are not for Glass-Steagall</span> . <span id="node290" class="highlighted">You are not for putting a firewall between this speculative , risky shadow banking behavior </span>. <span id="node295" class="highlighted">I am </span>, and <span id="node300" class="highlighted">the people of our country need a president who 's on their side , willing to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street</span> . <span id="node305" class="highlighted">We have to fulfill our promise</span><br>COOPER : Secretary Clinton I have to let you respond . [ applause ] <br>CLINTON : Well , you know ,<span id="node310" class="highlighted"> everybody on this stage has changed a position or two</span> . <span id="node315" class="highlighted">We 've been around a cumulative quite some period of time</span> . [ laughter ] You know , <span id="node320" class="highlighted">we know that if you are learning , you 're gon na change your position</span> . <span id="node325" class="highlighted">I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone</span> . But <span id="node330" class="highlighted">I have been on the forefront of dealing with climate change</span> , <span id="node335" class="highlighted">starting in 2009 , when President Obama and I crashed ( ph ) a meeting with the Chinese</span> and <span id="node340" class="highlighted">got them to sign up to the first international agreement to combat climate change that they 'd ever joined </span>.
