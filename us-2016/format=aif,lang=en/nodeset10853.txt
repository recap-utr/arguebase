CLINTON: <span class="highlighted" id="node6">The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node15">That's the most important part of this</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node22">How do we prevent attacks</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node27">How do we protect our people</span>?<br>And I think <span class="highlighted" id="node41">we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node58">I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey</span>. You know,<span class="highlighted" id="node65"> they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node76">they brought him down</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node85">we may find out more information</span> because<span class="highlighted" id="node92"> he is still alive</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node103">which may prove to be an intelligence benefit</span>.<br>So <span class="highlighted" id="node110">we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node121">That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of</span>.<br><span class="highlighted" id="node132">We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node143">We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node154">Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community</span>.<br><span class="highlighted" id="node161">They're on the front lines</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node172">They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node186">They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to</span>.<br>HOLT: <span class="highlighted" id="node197">Mr. Trump</span>...<br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node204">Well, I have to respond</span>.<br>HOLT:<span class="highlighted" id="node211"> Please respond</span>.<br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node218">The secretary said very strongly about working with—we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node233">You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node244">Under your direction, to a large extent</span>.<br>But <span class="highlighted" id="node255">you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node260">They were choking on the sanctions</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node271">now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going</span>.<br>But <span class="highlighted" id="node284">when you look at NATO</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node289">I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO</span>? And <span class="highlighted" id="node294">you have to understand, I'm a businessperson</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node299">I did really well</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node304">I have common sense. And I said, well, I'll tell you. I haven't given lots of thought to NATO. But two things</span>.<br>Number one, <span class="highlighted" id="node319">the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share</span>. Number two—and <span class="highlighted" id="node326">that bothers me</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node331">we should be asking—we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract</span>.<br>And, number two, I said, and very strongly, <span class="highlighted" id="node348">NATO could be obsolete</span>, because—and <span class="highlighted" id="node355">I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest—but I said, they do not focus on terror</span>. And<span class="highlighted" id="node366"> I was very strong. And I said it numerous times</span>.<br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node382">about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division</span>. And I think <span class="highlighted" id="node389">that's great. And I think we should get</span>—because <span class="highlighted" id="node396">we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node407">It's a lot of money to protect other people. But I'm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also</span>.<br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node414">they're going to do that</span>. And that was—believe me—I'm sure<span class="highlighted" id="node421"> I'm not going to get credit for it—but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO</span>.<br>I think <span class="highlighted" id="node438">we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node445">when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn't believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it</span>. They said...<br>CLINTON: <span class="highlighted" id="node452">Lester, we've covered</span>...<br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node459">No, wait a minute</span>.<br>CLINTON: <span class="highlighted" id="node466">We've covered this ground</span>.<br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node474">When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node481">It should have never happened</span>. Now, <span class="highlighted" id="node490">you're talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it's in over 30 countries. And you're going to stop them? I don't think so</span>.<br>HOLT: <span class="highlighted" id="node497"><span class="highlighted" id="node502">Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions</span></span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node509"> You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion</span>. What makes your...<br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node516">I did not support the war in Iraq</span>.<br>HOLT: <span class="highlighted" id="node527">In 2002</span>...<br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node538">That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her</span>, because she—frankly, I think <span class="highlighted" id="node550">the best person in her campaign is mainstream media</span>.<br>HOLT: <span class="highlighted" id="node562">My question is, since you supported it</span>...<br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted hlcurrent" id="node569">Just—would you like to hear</span>...<br>
