BAIER: Senator Paul, <span class="highlighted" id="node1">the first budget you proposed as senator cut all financial aid to Israel</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node26">You have since changed your view on that issue</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node33">What made you change your mind</span>. <br>PAUL: Well, let's be clear, <span class="highlighted" id="node40">I'm the only one on the stage who actually has a five-year budget that balances</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node47">I've put pencil to paper</span>... <br>UNKNOWN: I do. <br>PAUL: ... and I've said -- and I've said <span class="highlighted" id="node54">I would cut spending, and I've said exactly where</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node65">Each one of my budgets has taken a meat axe to foreign aid</span>, because I think<span class="highlighted" id="node72"> we ought to quit sending it to countries that hate us</span>. [applause] <br>I think <span class="highlighted" id="node83">we ought to quit sending it to countries that burn our flag</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node94">Israel is not one of those</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node101">even Benjamin Netanyahu said that ultimately, they will be stronger when they're independent</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node112">My position is exactly the same</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node119">We shouldn't borrow money from China to send it anywhere</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node124">why don't we start with eliminating aid to our enemies</span>. <br>BAIER: OK. But <span class="highlighted" id="node137">you still say that Israel could be one of the countries that is cut from financial aid</span>? <br>PAUL: <span class="highlighted" id="node158">I still say exactly what my original opinion is</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node153">Do you borrow money from China to send it to anyone</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node170">Out of your surplus, you can help your allies</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node177">Israel is a great ally</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node186">this is no particular animus of Israel</span>, but what I will say, and I will say over and over again, <span class="highlighted" id="node193">we cannot give away money we don't have</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node204">We do not project power from bankruptcy court</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node215">We're borrowing a million dollars a minute</span>. [applause] <br><span class="highlighted" id="node226">It's got to stop somewhere</span>. <br>BAIER: Governor Christie, <span class="highlighted" id="node233">what do you think of that answer</span>? <br>CHRISTIE: Well, listen. <br>You know, <span class="highlighted" id="node240">if we want to deal with these issues, we have to deal with them in a way that makes sense</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node252">I agree with what Dr. Carson said earlier</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node257">The first thing we need to do to make America stronger is to strengthen our military</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node277">I put out a really specific plan</span>: <span class="highlighted" id="node282">no less than 500,000 active duty soldiers in the Army. No less than 185,000 active duty marines in the Marine Corps. Bring us to a 350 ship Navy again, and modernize the Ohio class of submarines, and bring our Air Force back to 2,600 aircraft that are ready to go</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node300">Those are the kind of things that are going to send a clear message around the world</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node311">Those are the things that we need to start working on immediately to make our country stronger and make it better</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node322">Those are the things that we need to be able to be doing</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node333">as we move towards dealing with foreign aid, I don't disagree with Senator Paul's position that we shouldn't be funding our enemies</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node340">I absolutely believe that Israel is a priority to be able to fund and keep them strong and safe after eight years of this administration</span>. [applause] <br>BAIER: <span class="highlighted" id="node352">Governor, thank you</span>. <br>CRUZ: Brett, can I -- Brett, <span class="highlighted" id="node359">can I jump in on this one</span>? <br>BAIER: Senator, <span class="highlighted" id="node366">we're going to finish up with some more questions, thank you</span>. <br>KELLY: <span class="highlighted" id="node377">We have to stand you by</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node388">after the break, we're going to let the candidates make their closing statements, their final thoughts, and . . . God</span>. <br>Stay tuned for that. <br>[commercial break] <br>
