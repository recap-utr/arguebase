COOPER: Secretary Clinton? <br>CLINTON: Well, thank you, and thanks to everyone for hosting this first of the Democratic debates. <br>I'm Hillary Clinton. <span class="highlighted" id="node1">I have been proud and privileged to serve as first lady, as a senator from New York, and as secretary of state</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node6">I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node13">the grandmother of a wonderful one-year-old child</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node20">every day, I think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available not just for her, but for all of our children</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node27">I have spent a very long time — my entire adult life — looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead, and, in particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her God-given potential</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node34">I've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node41">I've put forward specific plans about how we're going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node48">At the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node55">Yes, of course, raise the minimum wage</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node62">we have to do so much more</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node69">including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them</span>. <br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node76">then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node83">Right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node95">I have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middle-class families</span>. <br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node100">I want to do more to help us balance family and work</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node109">I believe in equal pay for equal work for women</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node116">I also believe it's about time we had paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world</span>. [applause] <br><span class="highlighted" id="node123">During the course of the evening tonight, I'll have a chance to lay out all of my plans and the work that I've done behind them</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node130">for me, this is about bringing our country together again</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node138"><span class="highlighted" id="node137">I will do everything I can to heal the divides</span></span> — <span class="highlighted" id="node154">the divides economically</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node159">there's too much inequality</span>; <span class="highlighted" id="node176">the racial divides</span>; <span class="highlighted" id="node181">the continuing discrimination against the LGBT community</span> — <span class="highlighted" id="node186">so that we work together</span> and, yes, finally, <span class="highlighted" id="node191">fathers will be able to say to their daughters, you, too, can grow up to be president</span>. [applause] <br><br>
