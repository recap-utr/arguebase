KELLY: Senator Cruz, <span class="highlighted" id="node1">I wanna talk to you about this</span>, because<span class="highlighted" id="node6"> many of the Facebook users and -- and -- the -- the folks on Facebook wanted the candidates to speak to ISIS tonight</span>. <br>You asked the chairman of the joint chiefs a question: "<span class="highlighted" id="node17">What would it take to destroy ISIS in 90 days</span>?" He told you "<span class="highlighted" id="node27">ISIS will only be truly destroyed once they are rejected by the populations in which they hide</span>." And then <span class="highlighted" id="node44">you accused him of pushing Medicaid for the Iraqis</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node51">How would you destroy ISIS in 90 days</span>? <br>CRUZ: Megyn, <span class="highlighted" id="node58">we need a commander in chief that speaks the truth</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node69"> We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words, "radical Islamic terrorism"</span>. [applause] <br>When I asked General Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs,<span class="highlighted" id="node80"> what would be required militarily to destroy ISIS</span>, he said <span class="highlighted" id="node85">there is no military solution</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node90">We need to change the conditions on the ground</span> so <span class="highlighted" id="node95">that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node100">That, with all due respect, is nonsense</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node149">It's the same answer the State Department gave that we need to give them jobs</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node156"> What we need is a commander in chief who makes -- clear, if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant</span>. <br>KELLY: <span class="highlighted" id="node167">You don't see it as... [applause] ...an ideological problem -- an ideological problem in addition to a military one</span>? [applause] <br>CRUZ: Megyn, of course<span class="highlighted" id="node174"> it's an ideological problem</span>, that's one of the reasons <span class="highlighted" id="node179">I introduce the Expatriate Terrorist Act in the Senate that said if any American travels to the Middle East and joining ISIS, that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they don't use a passport to come back and wage jihad on Americans</span>. [applause] <br>Yes, <span class="highlighted" id="node196">it is ideological</span>, and let me contrast President Obama, who <span class="highlighted" id="node207">at the prayer breakfast, essentially acted as an apologist</span>. He said, "<span class="highlighted" id="node212">Well, gosh, the crusades, the inquisitions</span>--"[timer sounds] <br><span class="highlighted" id="node229">We need a president that shows the courage that Egypt's President al-Sisi did, a Muslim, when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world</span>. [applause] <br>KELLY: Governor Bush,<span class="highlighted" id="node236"> for days on end in this campaign, you struggled to answer a question about whether knowing what we know now</span>... <br>BUSH: ...<span class="highlighted" id="node243">I remember.</span>.. <br>KELLY: ...we would've invaded Iraq... <br>BUSH: ...<span class="highlighted" id="node250">I remember, Megyn</span>. [laughter] <br>KELLY: <span class="highlighted" id="node259">I remember it too</span>, and<span class="highlighted" id="node266"> ISIS, of course, is now thriving there</span>. <br>You finally said, "<span class="highlighted" id="node271">No</span>." <br><span class="highlighted" id="node284">To the families of those who died in that war who say they liberated a country and deposed a ruthless dictator, how do you look at them now and say that your brothers war was a mistake</span>? <br>BUSH: <span class="highlighted" id="node289">Knowing what we know now, with faulty intelligence, and not having security be the first priority when -- when we invaded</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node294">it was a mistake</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node315">I wouldn't have gone in, however</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node320">for the people that did lose their lives, and the families that suffer because of it</span> -- <span class="highlighted" id="node337">I know this full well</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node342">as governor of the state of Florida, I called every one of them</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node347">Every one of them that I could find to tell them that I was praying for them, that I cared about them, and it was really hard to do</span>. <br>And, <span class="highlighted" id="node352">every one of them said that their child did not die in vain, or their wife, of their husband did not die in vain</span>. <br>So, <span class="highlighted" id="node357">while it was difficult for me to do it was based on that</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node384">Here's the lesson that we should take from this, which relates to this whole subject</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node389">Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node394">He lef</span>t, and <span class="highlighted" id="node399">when he left Al Qaida was done for</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node404">ISIS was created</span> because [timer sounds] of<span class="highlighted" id="node409"> the void that we left</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node414">that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node447">To honor the people that died, we need to -- we need to --- stop the -- Iran agreement, for sure</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node452">the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node463">we need to take out ISIS with every tool at our disposal</span>.
