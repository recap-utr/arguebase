Y<span class="highlighted" id="node44">ou look at Egypt</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node49">probably the best relationship we've had in Israel, at least in my lifetime, incredibly important</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node62">You look at the Saudis</span> -- <span class="highlighted" id="node67">in fact, earlier this year, I met with Saudi leaders, and leaders from the United Arab Emirates, and I asked them what's the greatest challenge in the world today? Set aside the Iran deal. They said it's the disengagement of America</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node72">We are leading from behind under the Obama-Clinton doctrine</span> -- <span class="highlighted" id="node91">America's a great country</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node96">We need to stand up and start leading again, and we need to have allies, not just in Israel, but throughout the Persian Gulf</span>. <br>KELLY: Dr. Carson, i<span class="highlighted" id="node113">n one of his first acts as commander in chief, President Obama signed an executive order banning enhanced interrogation techniques in fighting terror</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node139">As president, would you bring back water boarding</span>? <br>CARSON: Well, thank you, Megyn, <span class="highlighted" id="node127">I wasn't sure I was going to get to talk again</span>.

[applause] <br>We. . .uh. . .<span class="highlighted" id="node190">we've gotten into this -- this mindset of fighting politically correct wars</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node195">There is no such thing as a politically correct war</span>. [applause] <br>And,<span class="highlighted" id="node200"> the left, of course, will say Carson doesn't believe in the Geneva Convention</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node205">Carson doesn't believe in fighting stupid wars</span>. And -- and <span class="highlighted" id="node210">what we have to remember is we want to utilize the tremendous intellect that we have in the military to win wars</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node216">And</span> I<span class="highlighted" id="node215">'ve talked to a lot of the generals, a lot of our advanced people</span>. And believe me,<span class="highlighted" id="node221"> if we gave them the mission, which is what the commander-in-chief does, they would be able to carry it out</span>. <br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node226">if we don't tie their hands behind their back, they will do it...[timer sounds]...extremely effectively</span>.
