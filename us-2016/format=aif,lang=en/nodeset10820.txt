COOPER: And welcome back to the final round of the CNN Democratic presidential debate. <br>This is a question to each of you. Each of you, by the way, are going to have closing statements to make. Each of you will have 90 seconds. But a final question to each of you. If you can, just try to — 15 seconds if you can. <br>Governor Chafee, Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, "<span class="highlighted" id="node1">I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made</span>." <span class="highlighted" id="node10">You've all made a few people upset over your political careers</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node15">Which enemy are you most proud of</span>? [laughter]<br>CHAFEE: I guess <span class="highlighted" id="node20">the coal lobby</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node31">I've worked hard for climate change</span> and<span class="highlighted" id="node36"> I want to work with the coal lobby</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node41">in my time in the Senate, tried to bring them to the table</span> so that <span class="highlighted" id="node46">we could address carbon dioxide</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node59">I'm proud to be at odds with the coal lobby</span>. <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node90">Governor O'Malley</span>? <br>O'MALLEY: <span class="highlighted" id="node97">The National Rifle Association</span>. [applause] <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node108">Secretary Clinton</span>? <br>CLINTON: Well, in addition to <span class="highlighted" id="node115">the NRA</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node126">the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians. [laughter]<br>Probably the Republicans</span>. [laughter and applause] <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node127">Senator Sanders</span>? <br>SANDERS: As <span class="highlighted" id="node135">someone who has taken on probably every special interest that there is in Washington</span>, I <span class="highlighted" id="node140">would lump Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry at the top of my life of people who do not like me</span>. [applause] <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node159">Senator Webb</span>? <br>WEBB: <span class="highlighted" id="node177">I'd have to say</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node164">the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me, but he's not around right now to talk to</span>. <br><br>
