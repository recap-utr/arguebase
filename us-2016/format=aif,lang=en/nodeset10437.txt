COOPER : Secretary Clinton , <span class="highlighted" id="node893">on the campaign trail , Governor Webb has said that he would never have used military force in Libya </span>and <span class="highlighted" id="node894">that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was inevitable</span> . <span id="node6" class="highlighted">Should you have seen that attack coming ?</span> CLINTON : Well , <span id="node17" class="highlighted">let 's remember what was going on</span> . <span id="node22" class="highlighted">We had a murderous dictator , Gadhafi , who had American blood on his hands</span> , as I 'm sure you remember , <span id="node27" class="highlighted">threatening to massacre large numbers of the Libyan people</span> . <span id="node32" class="highlighted">We had our closest allies in Europe burning up the phone lines begging us to help them try to prevent what they saw as a mass genocide , in their words</span> . <span id="node65" class="highlighted">And we had the Arabs standing by our side saying , `` We want you to help us deal with Gadhafi . ''</span> <span id="node74" class="highlighted">Our response , <span id="node79" class="highlighted">which I think was smart power at its best</span> , is that the United States will not lead this</span> . <span id="node90" class="highlighted">We will provide essential , unique capabilities that we have </span>, but <span id="node95" class="highlighted">the Europeans and the Arabs had to be first over the line</span> . <span id="node100" class="highlighted">We did not put one single American soldier on the ground in Libya</span> . <span id="node105" class="highlighted">And I 'll say this for the Libyan people</span> ... COOPER : But <span id="node110" class="highlighted">American citizens did lose their lives in Benghazi </span>. CLINTON : But let — I 'll get to that . But <span id="node121" class="highlighted">I think it 's important</span> , since <span id="node140" class="highlighted">I understand Senator Webb 's very strong feelings about this , to explain where we were then </span>and <span id="node147" class="highlighted">to point out that I think President Obama made the right decision at the time</span> . And <span id="node152" class="highlighted">the Libyan people had a free election the first time since 1951</span> . And you know what , <span id="node157" class="highlighted">they voted for moderates </span>, <span id="node162" class="highlighted">they voted with the hope of democracy</span> . <span id="node167" class="highlighted"><span id="node168" class="highlighted">Because of the Arab Spring</span></span> , <span id="node173" class="highlighted">because of a lot of other things</span> ,<span id="node178" class="highlighted"> there was turmoil to be followed</span> . But <span id="node198" class="highlighted">unless you believe the United States should not send diplomats to any place that is dangerous </span>, <span id="node203" class="highlighted"><span id="node204" class="highlighted">which I do not</span></span> , then <span id="node215" class="highlighted">when we send them forth , there is always the potential for danger and risk</span> . COOPER : Governor O'Malley ? WEBB : Can I ... [ crosstalk ] O'MALLEY : Anderson , I think we are learning ... [ crosstalk ] O'MALLEY : <span id="node220" class="highlighted">Anderson , I think there 's lessons to be learned from Benghazi</span> . And <span id="node225" class="highlighted">those lessons are that we need to do a much better job as a nation of having human intelligence on the ground so that we know who the emerging next generation leaders are that are coming up to replace a dictator when his time on this planet ends </span>. And <span id="node230" class="highlighted">I believe that 's what Chris Stevens was trying to do</span> . But <span id="node235" class="highlighted">he did not have the tools </span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node284">We have failed as a country to invest in the human intelligence that would allow us to make not only better decisions in Libya , but better decisions in Syria today</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node291">it 's a huge national security failing</span> . COOPER : Senator Webb , I want you to be able to respond . WEBB : Thank you . [ crosstalk ] COOPER : Senator Webb ? WEBB : <span class="highlighted" id="node298">This is not about Benghazi per se</span> . To me<span class="highlighted" id="node307"> it is the inevitability of something like Benghazi occurring in the way that we intervened in Libya</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node314">We had no treaties at risk</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node319">We had no Americans at risk</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node324">There was no threat of attack or imminent attack</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node329">There is plenty of time for a president to come to the Congress and request authority to use military force in that situation</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node334">I called for it on the Senate floor again and again</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node339">I called for it in Senate hearings</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node344">It is not a wise thing to do</span> .

So that <span class="highlighted" id="node718">Iran deal did not allow Russia to come in</span> . COOPER : OK . Senator , I can give you 30 seconds to respond . WEBB : I believe that <span class="highlighted" id="node748">the signal that we sent to the region when the Iran nuclear deal was concluded was that we are accepting Iran 's greater position on this very important balance of power , among our greatest ally Israel , and the Sunnis represented by the Saudi regime , and Iran</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node749">It was a position of weakness</span> and I think <span class="highlighted" id="node750">it encouraged the acts that we 've seen in the past several weeks</span> . <br>
