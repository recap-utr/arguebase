COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node6">Governor Chafee, you and Hillary Clinton both voted for the Patriot Act which created the NSA surveillance program</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node11">You've emphasized civil liberties, privacy during your campaign</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node18">Aren't these two things in conflict?</span> <br><br>CHAFEE: <span class="highlighted" id="node31">No</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node42">that was another 99 to one vote for the Patriot Act</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node53">it was seen as at the time modernizing our ability to do what we've always done to tap phones which always required a warrant</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node60">I voted for that</span>. <br><br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node73">Do you regret that vote?</span> <br><br>CHAFEE: <span class="highlighted" id="node80">No, no</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node87">As long as you're getting a warrant, I believe that under the Fourth Amendment, you should be able to do surveillance</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node98">you need a warrant</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node105">That's what the Fourth Amendment says</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node116">in the Patriot Act, section 215 started to get broadened too far</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node123">I would be in favor of addressing and reforming section 215 of the Patriot Act</span>. <br><br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node134">Secretary Clinton, do you regret your vote on the Patriot Act?</span> <br><br>CLINTON: <span class="highlighted" id="node173"><span class="highlighted" id="node141">No, I don't</span></span>.

And<span class="highlighted" id="node182"> it is true that it did require that there be a process</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node196">What happened, however, is that the Bush administration began to chip away at that process</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node207">I began to speak out about their use of warrantless surveillance and the other behavior that they engaged in</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node214">We always have to keep the balance of civil liberties, privacy and security</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node225">It's not easy in a democracy</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node232">we have to keep it in mind</span>. <br><br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node239">Senator â€” Senator Sanders, you're the only one on this stage who voted against the Patriot Act in 2001</span>...
