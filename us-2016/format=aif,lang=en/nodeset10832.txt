WALLACE: Gentlemen, we're going to turn now to the subject of the economy, jobs and money and the government. And Governor Bush, I'm going to start with you. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node1">You have made a bold promise in your announcement</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node6">You have promised four percent economic growth and 19 million new jobs if you are fortunate enough to serve two terms as president</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node13">That many jobs, 19 million, would be triple what your father and your brother accomplished together</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node26">four percent growth, the last president to average that was Lyndon Johnson during the height of the Vietnam War</span>. So question, <span class="highlighted" id="node39">how on Earth specifically would you pull that off?</span> <br><br>BUSH: <span class="highlighted" id="node52">We've done it 27 times since World War II</span>. I think <span class="highlighted" id="node59">we need to lift our spirits and have high, lofty expectations for this great country of ours</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node75">The new normal of two percent that the left is saying you can't do anything about is so dangerous for our country</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node82">There's 6 million people living in poverty today, more than when Barack Obama got elected</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node89">6.5 million people are working part-time, most of whom want to work full-time</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node96">We've created rules and taxes on top of every aspiration of people</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node103">the net result is we're not growing fast</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node114">income's not growing</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node125">A four percent growth strategy means you fix a convoluted tax code</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node132">You get in and you change every aspect of regulations that are job killers</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node171">You get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesn't suppress wages and kill jobs</span>. [applause] <br><span class="highlighted" id="node182">You embrace the energy revolution in our country</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node193">This president and Hillary Clinton, who can't even say she's for the XL pipeline even after she's left?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node200">Give me a break</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node207">Of course we're for it</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node214">We should be for these things to create high sustained economic growth</span>. And frankly, [timer sounds] <span class="highlighted" id="node223">fixing our immigration system and turning it into an economic driver is part of this as well</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node228">We can do this</span>. [applause] <br>
