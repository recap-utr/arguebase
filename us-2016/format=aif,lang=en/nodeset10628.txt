HOLT : Well , <span class="highlighted" id="node1">I 'll let her answer that</span> . But <span class="highlighted" id="node6">let me just admonish the audience one more time</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node13">There was an agreement</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node20">We did ask you to be silent</span> , so <span class="highlighted" id="node27">it would be helpful for us</span> . Secretary Clinton ? <div><br></div><div>CLINTON : Well , <span class="highlighted" id="node34">I think you 've seen another example of bait-and- switch here</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node41">For 40 years , everyone running for president has released their tax returns</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node55">You can go and see nearly , I think , 39 , 40 years of our tax returns</span> , but <span class="highlighted" id="node62">everyone has done it</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node69">We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you 're under audit</span>.So <span class="highlighted" id="node76">you 've got to ask yourself , why wo n't he release his tax returns ?</span> And I think <span class="highlighted" id="node88">there may be a couple of reasons</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node95">First , maybe he 's not as rich as he says he is</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node106">Second , maybe he 's not as charitable as he claims to be</span>.Third , <span class="highlighted" id="node492">we do n't know all of his business dealings</span> , but <span class="highlighted" id="node499">we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $ 650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks</span> . Or <span class="highlighted" id="node120">maybe he does n't want the American people , all of you watching tonight , to know that he 's paid nothing in federal taxes</span> , because <span class="highlighted" id="node127">the only years that anybody 's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node139">they showed he did n't pay any federal income tax</span>.<div><br></div><div>TRUMP : <span class="highlighted" id="node162"><span class="highlighted" id="node163">That makes me smart</span></span>.</div><div><br></div><div>CLINTON : So <span class="highlighted" id="node172">if he 's paid zero , that means zero for troops , zero for vets , zero for schools or health</span> . And I think <span class="highlighted" id="node179">probably he 's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are </span>, because<span class="highlighted" id="node186"> it must be something really important , even terrible , that he 's trying to hide</span>.And <span class="highlighted" id="node197">the financial disclosure statements , they do n't give you the tax rate</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node208">They do n't give you all the details that tax returns would</span> . And it just seems to me that <span class="highlighted" id="node215">this is something that the American people deserve to see</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node222">I have no reason to believe that he 's ever going to release his tax returns</span> , because <span class="highlighted" id="node229">there 's something he 's hiding</span>.And <span class="highlighted" id="node240">we 'll guess</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node247">We 'll keep guessing at what it might be that he 's hiding</span> . But I think the question is , <span class="highlighted" id="node258">were he ever to get near the White House , what would be those conflicts ?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node265">Who does he owe money to ?</span> Well , <span class="highlighted" id="node270">he owes you the answers to that</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node275">he should provide them</span>.</div><div><br></div><div>HOLT : He also—<span class="highlighted" id="node302">he also raised the issue of your e-mails</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node309">Do you want to respond to that ?</span> </div><div><br></div><div>CLINTON : <span class="highlighted" id="node316">I do</span> . You know , <span class="highlighted" id="node323">I made a mistake using a private e- mail</span>.</div><div><br></div><div>TRUMP : <span class="highlighted" id="node330">That 's for sure</span>.</div><div><br></div><div>CLINTON : And <span class="highlighted" id="node339">if I had to do it over again , I would , obviously , do it differently</span> . But <span class="highlighted" id="node346">I 'm not going to make any excuses</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node364">It was a mistake</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node356">I take responsibility for that</span>.</div><div><br></div><div>HOLT : Mr. Trump ? </div><div><br></div><div>TRUMP : <span class="highlighted" id="node373">That was more than a mistake</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node389">That was done purposely</span> . OK ? <span class="highlighted" id="node400">That was not a mistake</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node405">That was done purposely</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node420">When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment , taking the Fifth so they 're not prosecuted</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node425"><span class="highlighted" id="node428">when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth</span></span> , I think <span class="highlighted" id="node433">it 's disgraceful</span> . And believe me , <span class="highlighted" id="node451">this country thinks it's—really thinks it 's disgraceful , also</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node487">As far as my tax returns , you do n't learn that much from tax returns</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node532">That I can tell you</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node527">You learn a lot from financial disclosure</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node545">you should go down and take a look at that</span>.The other thing , <span class="highlighted" id="node556">I 'm extremely underleveraged</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node568">The report that said $ 650</span>—<span class="highlighted" id="node575">which , by the way , <span class="highlighted" id="node586">a lot of friends of mine that know my business</span> say , boy , that 's really not a lot of money</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node597">It 's not a lot of money relative to what I had</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node615">The buildings that were in question , they said in the same report , which was—actually , it was n't even a bad story , to be honest with you , but the buildings are worth $ 3.9 billion</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node633">the $ 650 is n't even on that</span> . But <span class="highlighted" id="node640">it 's not $ 650</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node647">It 's much less than that</span>.But <span class="highlighted" id="node654">I could give you a list of banks</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node661">I would—if that would help you , I would give you a list of banks</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node672">These are very fine institutions</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node679">very fine banks</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node690">I could do that very quickly</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node703">I am very underleveraged</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node714">I have a great company</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node725">I have a tremendous income</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node737">the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node744">It 's because it 's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money</span>.When <span class="highlighted" id="node755">we have $ 20 trillion in debt</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node760">our country 's a mess</span> , you know , <span class="highlighted" id="node765">it 's one thing to have $ 20 trillion in debt</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node823">our roads are good</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node829">our bridges are good</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node834">everything 's in great shape</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node839">our airports</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node775">Our airports are like from a third world country</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node780">You land at LaGuardia , you land at Kennedy , you land at LAX , you land at Newark , and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible—you come in from China , you see these incredible airports</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node850">you land</span>—<span class="highlighted" id="node791">we 've become a third world country</span>.So <span class="highlighted" id="node851">the worst of all things has happened</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node862">We owe $ 20 trillion</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node867">we 're a mess</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node879">We have n't even started</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node896">we 've spent $ 6 trillion in the Middle East</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node901">according to a report that I just saw</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node926">Whether it 's 6 or 5</span> , but<span class="highlighted" id="node933"> it looks like it 's 6</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node940">$ 6 trillion in the Middle East</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node949"><span class="highlighted" id="node950">we could have rebuilt our country twice</span></span>.And <span class="highlighted" id="node957">it 's really a shame</span> .

[ applause ] And the other thing I think is important ... TRUMP : <span class="highlighted" id="node1077">It would be squandered , too , believe me</span>.</div><div><br></div><div>CLINTON : ... is if your—<span class="highlighted" id="node1089">if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business , then I think we should talk about that</span> . You know ,<span class="highlighted" id="node1096"> your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys</span>.And , indeed , <span class="highlighted" id="node1103">I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses</span> , Donald . <span class="highlighted" id="node1132">I 've met dishwashers , painters , architects , glass installers , marble installers , drapery installers , like my dad was , who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do</span>.</div></div>
