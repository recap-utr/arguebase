WALLACE : Welcome back to FOX News/Facebook Republican Debate Night . We 're going to continue the questions now on illegal immigration . We kind of ended with a cliffhanger there . So let 's continue the conversation . <span class="highlighted" id="node1">Governor Kasich , I know you do n't like to talk about Donald Trump</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node6">But I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said</span> . When you say that the American government is stupid , <span class="highlighted" id="node26">that the Mexican government is sending criminals</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node35">that we 're being bamboozled</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node44">is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration</span> ? <div>KASICH : Chris , first of all , <span class="highlighted" id="node70">I was just saying to Chris Christie , they say we 're outspoken</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node77">we need to take lessons from Donald Trump</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node84">if we 're really going to learn it</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node100">Here is the thing about Donald Trump . Donald Trump is hitting a nerve in this country</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node107">He is . He 's hitting a nerve</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node116">People are frustrated</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node128">They 're fed up</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node141">They do n't think the government is working for them</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node158">for people who want to just tune him out , they 're making a mistake</span> . Now , <span class="highlighted" id="node165">he 's got his solutions</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node172">Some of us have other solutions</span> . You know , look , <span class="highlighted" id="node179">I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node190">Has n't been done since</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node197">I was a military reformer </span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node204">I took the state of Ohio from an $ 8 billion hole and a 350,000 job loss to a $ 2 billion surplus and a gain of 350,000 jobs</span> . </div><div>WALLACE : Respectfully , <span class="highlighted" id="node211">can we talk about illegal immigration</span> ? </div><div>KASICH : But the point is that <span class="highlighted" id="node218">we all have solutions</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node229">Mr. Trump is touching a nerve</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node236">people want the wall to be built</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node247">They want to see an end to illegal immigration</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node258">They want to see it</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node276">we all do</span> . But <span class="highlighted" id="node295">we all have different ways of getting there</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node300">you 're going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are</span> . </div><div>WALLACE : All right , well , <span class="highlighted" id="node313">Senator Rubio , let me see if I can do better with you</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node320">Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node325">their leaders are smart</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node330">all of these illegals coming over are criminals</span> ? </div><div>RUBIO : <span class="highlighted" id="node353">Let me set the record straight on a couple of things</span> . The first is ,<span class="highlighted" id="node360"> the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node367">They 're coming from Guatemala , El Salvador , Honduras</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node378">Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority</span> . I also believe <span class="highlighted" id="node389">we need a fence</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node396">The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node403">we have to be able to deal with that too </span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node414">that 's why you need an e-verify system</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node419">you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration</span> . But <span class="highlighted" id="node432">I agree with what Governor Kasich just said</span> .<span class="highlighted" id="node439"> People are frustrated </span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node449">T<span class="highlighted" id="node448">his is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration</span> </span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node457">There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node468">people feel like we 're being taken advantage of</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node475">We feel like despite our generosity , we 're being taken advantage of</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node484">let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node491">The people that call my office , who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node498">they 've paid their fees , and they hired a lawyer , and they ca n't get in</span> . And t<span class="highlighted" id="node505">hey 're wondering , maybe they should come illegally</span> . [ applause ] And so<span class="highlighted" id="node513"> <span class="highlighted" id="node512">these are important issues</span> , and we should address it</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node528">It 's a serious problem that needs to be addressed</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node537">otherwise we 're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years , like we have for the last 30 years</span> . </div><div>WALLACE : Governor Walker .

Other than politics , could you explain<span class="highlighted" id="node577"> why in the last two years you 've changed your position on a path to citizenship</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node586">are there other past positions that we should n't hold you to</span> ?
