  <span class="highlighted" id="node66">That's... I have no words</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node71">You're correct</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node76">as a scientist I just died a

    Nixplosion: Well ... <span class="highlighted" id="node170">Human DNA does suggest that human babies are human</span> ...
  <span class="highlighted" id="node175">Cant explain that</span><br>
    stagshore: <span class="highlighted" id="node188">Yup on par there, 100%</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node197">why they used that as facts for pro-life
  is just sad</span>.<br>

    stagshore: <span class="highlighted" id="node249">Nope only half human</span>! <span class="highlighted" id="node266">Unless you want to consider every 2 sperm

    CrimsonEnigma: I mean,<span class="highlighted" id="node291"> I disagree with it</span>, but<span class="highlighted" id="node302"> I could kind of see the
  argument (that is, once you get a complete set of 46 chromosomes, you're a
  human, which, naturally, happens at conception</span>). Again, <span class="highlighted" id="node315">I disagree with it
  immensely</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node326">I could at least tell what he was saying</span>...<br>
    stagshore: <span class="highlighted" id="node331">See I would agree that this was actually an argument if he knew
  that</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node338">it's clear he didn't</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node343">How do I know</span>?<br>
    He said something along the lines of (indirect-direct quote) "recently
  scientists have discovered that unborn children are human".<br>
    <span class="highlighted" id="node365">Keyword: recently... ya no</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node370">Scientists have known this for a very long time
  now</span>.<br>
    annoyingstranger: <span class="highlighted" id="node397">Dinosaur Nuclear Atoms, obviously</span>.<br>
    grungebot5000Popcorn: Actually, <span class="highlighted" id="node402">I'm always curious as to why the pro-life
  crowd doesn't pull out "a fetus has 46 unique chromosomes and therefore
  is its own person" more often</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node409">Seems like a reasonable, scientific way to
  back up their central argument</span><br>
    yankeesfan13:<span class="highlighted" id="node423"> I don't think Huckabee knows what chromosomes are</span>.<br>
    shoe788: <span class="highlighted" id="node430">Cancer can also have unique chromosomes</span>.<br>
    grungebot5000Popcorn: <span class="highlighted" id="node435">not 46 of em, patterned all human-wise</span><br>
    apul_madeekaud: Because <span class="highlighted" id="node452">the hair on the floor of the barbershop has 46
  chromosomes</span>. It doesn't make it any more of a person.<br>
    grungebot5000Popcorn: <span class="highlighted" id="node463">The keyword is "unique."</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node468">Those 46 are
  identical to the person it came from</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node473">Not the case with mother/fetus</span><br>
    apul_madeekaud: <span class="highlighted" id="node494">What about identical twins</span>?<br>
    grungebot5000Popcorn: <span class="highlighted" id="node499">you don't give birth to your own twin</span><br>
    apul_madeekaud: <span class="highlighted" id="node516">Thanks for clearing that up</span><br>

    look 1 point: Yep. <span class="highlighted" id="node530">That one blew my mind</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node535">His concept of science is so
  fucked up that we need scientists to study it</span>.<br>
    redditallreddy: <span class="highlighted" id="node548">Uhâ€¦ the day after conception (actually, before, but I'm
  being overly cautious), the fertilized egg has its own complete genetic code
  that is different from both the mother's and father's</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node553">We now do blood
  testing at about 14 weeks for genetic abnormalities by sampling the mother's
  blood and removing the waste DNA from the fetus</span>.<br>
    <span class="highlighted" id="node558">The statement you posted is literally true</span>.<br>
    <span class="highlighted" id="node563">"Human" does not necessarily mean "living person" under
  the law</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node568">a well-developed fetus is "human," scientifically, by
  its genetics</span>.<br>
    stagshore: <span class="highlighted" id="node601">Yup exactly, I'm 100% agreeing with you</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node610">He insisted it was a
  "recent" discovery, we have known for a long time the genetics of a
  human</span>.<br>
    <span class="highlighted" id="node615">The point he was making was that this evidence made it a "living
  person",</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node620">which is why its hilariously bad evidence</span>.<br>
