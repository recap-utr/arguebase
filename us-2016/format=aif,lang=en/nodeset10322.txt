  <span class="highlighted" id="node27">Seemed very pragmatic and realistic, almost like he takes it personally</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node32">You
  could actually hear some, what seemed like normal, emotion from him when he
  spoke briefly about the people who call his office about immigrating here
  legally</span>.<br>

  compete with the others feeding the base red meat</span>.<br>
