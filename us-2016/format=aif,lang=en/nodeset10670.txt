COOPER : All right . We 're going to take a short break . Do these candidates see eye to eye on an issue that is driving a big wedge between Republicans ? That is next . We 'll be right back . [ applause ] [ commercial break ] <div><br><div>COOPER : And welcome back . We are live in Nevada , in Las Vegas , at the Wynn Resort for the first Democratic presidential debate . The questions continue . We begin with Secretary Clinton . <span class="highlighted" id="node1">Secretary Clinton , you are going to be testifying before Congress next week about your e-mails</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node6">For the last eight months , you have n't been able to put this issue behind you</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node13">You dismissed it</span> ;<span class="highlighted" id="node18"> you joked about it</span> ; <span class="highlighted" id="node23">you called it a mistake</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node28">What does that say about your ability to handle far more challenging crises as president</span> ? </div><div><br></div><div>CLINTON : Well , <span class="highlighted" id="node46">I 've taken responsibility for it</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node57">I did say it was a mistake . What I did was allowed by the State Department , but it was n't the best choice</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node68">I have been as transparent as I know to be</span> ,<span class="highlighted" id="node79"> turning over 55,000 pages of my e-mails , asking that they be made public</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node90">you 're right</span> .<span class="highlighted" id="node95"> I am going to be testifying</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node100">I 've been asking to testify for some time and to do it in public , which was not originally agreed to</span> . But<span class="highlighted" id="node119"> let 's just take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the Republican National Committee</span> . [ applause ] <span class="highlighted" id="node124">It is a partisan vehicle</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node129">as admitted by the House Republican majority leader , Mr. McCarthy , to drive down my poll numbers</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node134">Big surprise . And that 's what they have attempted to do . I am still standing</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node151">I am happy to be part of this debate</span> . [ applause ] And<span class="highlighted" id="node158"> I intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the American people</span> . You know , I believe strongly that <span class="highlighted" id="node165">we need to be talking about what people talk to me about</span> , like <span class="highlighted" id="node176">how are we going to make college affordable</span> ? <span class="highlighted" id="node187">How are we going to pay down student debt</span> ? </div><div><br></div><div>COOPER : Secretary ...</div><div> </div><div>CLINTON : <span class="highlighted" id="node194">How are we going to get health care for everybody</span> ... [ crosstalk ] </div><div><br></div><div>COOPER : Secretary Clinton , Secretary Clinton , with all due respect , it 's a little hard — I mean , <span class="highlighted" id="node201">is n't it a little bit hard to call this just a partisan issue</span> ? <span class="highlighted" id="node212">There 's an FBI investigation</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node223">President Obama himself just two days ago said this is a legitimate issue</span> .</div><div> </div><div>CLINTON : Well ,<span class="highlighted" id="node230"> I never said it was n't legitimate</span> . I said that <span class="highlighted" id="node241">I have answered all the questions and I will certainly be doing so again before this committee</span> . But I think <span class="highlighted" id="node257">it would be really unfair not to look at the entire picture</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node264">This committee has spent $ 4.5 million of taxpayer money</span> , and<span class="highlighted" id="node275"> they said that they were trying to figure out what we could do better to protect our diplomats so that something like Benghazi would n't happen again</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node282">There were already seven committee reports about what to do</span> . So I think <span class="highlighted" id="node289">it 's pretty clear what their obvious goal is</span> . </div><div><br></div><div>COOPER : Thank you . </div><div><br></div><div>CLINTON : But <span class="highlighted" id="node300">I 'll be there</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node311">I 'll answer their questions</span> . But <span class="highlighted" id="node322">tonight , I want to talk not about my e-mails , but about what the American people want from the next president of the United States</span> . [ applause ] </div><div><br></div><div>COOPER : <span class="highlighted" id="node329">Senator Sanders</span> ? </div><div><br></div><div>SANDERS : Let me say this . [ applause ] Let me say — <span class="highlighted" id="node336">let me say something that may not be great politics </span>. But I think <span class="highlighted" id="node348">the secretary is right</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node355">that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails</span> . [ applause ] </div><div><br></div><div>CLINTON : <span class="highlighted" id="node366">Thank you</span> . Me , too . Me , too . </div><div><br></div><div>SANDERS : You know ? <span class="highlighted" id="node373">The middle class — Anderson , and let me say something about the media , as well</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node383">I go around the country , talk to a whole lot of people</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node390">Middle class in this country is collapsing</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node397">We have 27 million people living in poverty</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node408">We have massive wealth and income inequality</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node417">Our trade policies have cost us millions of decent jobs</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node428">The American people want to know whether we 're going to have a democracy or an oligarchy as a result of Citizens Union</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node435">Enough of the e-mails</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node446">Let 's talk about the real issues facing America</span> .

But <span class="highlighted" id="node478">I got to be honest , Governor Chafee , for the record , on the campaign trail , you 've said a different thing</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node485">You said this is a huge issue</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node500">Standing here in front of Secretary Clinton , are you willing to say that to her face</span> ? </div><div><br></div><div>CHAFEE : <span class="highlighted" id="node507">Absolutely</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node519">We have to repair American credibility after we told the world that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction , which he did n't</span> . So <span class="highlighted" id="node530">there 's an issue of American credibility out there</span> . So <span class="highlighted" id="node541">any time someone is running to be our leader , and a world leader , which the American president is , credibility is an issue out there with the world </span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node552">we have repair work to be done</span> . I think <span class="highlighted" id="node563">we need someone that has the best in ethical standards as our next president</span> .
