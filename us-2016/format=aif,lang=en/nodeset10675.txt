But <span class="highlighted" id="node614">personally , I 'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that</span>.And <span class="highlighted" id="node621">Donald never tells you what he would do</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node628">Would he have started a war ?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node635">Would he have bombed Iran ?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node642">If he 's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before , then he should tell us what his alternative would be</span> .
