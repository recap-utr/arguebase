COOPER: Governor — Governor... [applause] <br>Governor O'Malley... [applause] <br>Governor,<span class="highlighted" id="node1"> it's popular in the room, but a lot of people do want to know these answers</span>. <br>Governor O'Malley, <span class="highlighted" id="node6">you expressed concern on the campaign trail that the Democratic Party is, and I quote, "being defined by Hillary Clinton's email scandal</span>." <br><span class="highlighted" id="node17">You heard her answer</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node22">do you still feel that way tonight</span>? <br>O'MALLEY: I believe that now that <span class="highlighted" id="node51">we're finally having debates, Anderson, that we don't have to be defined by the email scandal, and how long — what the FBI's asking about</span>. Instead, <span class="highlighted" id="node58">we can talk about affordable college</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node63">making college debt free</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node68">all the issues</span>. Which is why — and <span class="highlighted" id="node73">I see the chair of the DNC here</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node78">look how glad we are actually to be talking about the issues that matter the most to people around the kitchen table</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node101">We need to get wages to go up</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node106">college more affordable</span>... <br>COOPER: ...<span class="highlighted" id="node111">Thank you, governor</span>. <br>O'MALLEY: ...<span class="highlighted" id="node116">we need to make American 100 percent clean electric by 2050</span>. <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node133">I want to talk about issues of race in America</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node138">for that I want to start of with Don Lemon</span>. <br>LEMON: <span class="highlighted" id="node147">Alright, Anderson, thank you very much</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node154"><span class="highlighted" id="node155">I'm not sure how to follow that, but this question is about something that has tripped some of the candidates up out on the campaign trail</span></span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node163"> Can you hear me</span>? <br><span class="highlighted" id="node168">Can't hear me in the room. OK, here we go again, as I said</span>... <br>WILKINS: ...law school. My question for the candidates is, <span class="highlighted" id="node177">do black lives matter</span>, or <span class="highlighted" id="node182">do all lives matter</span>? <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node191">The question from Arthur</span>... <br>LEMON: ...<span class="highlighted" id="node199">There we go</span>... <br>COOPER: ...<span class="highlighted" id="node206">Do black lives matter</span>, or <span class="highlighted" id="node211">do all lives matter</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node228">Let's put that question to Senator Sanders</span>. <br>SANDERS: <span class="highlighted" id="node235">Black lives matter</span>. [cheering] And the reason — the reason those words matter is the <span class="highlighted" id="node252">African American community knows that on any given day some innocent person like Sandra Bland can get into a car, and then three days later she's going to end up dead in jail</span>, or<span class="highlighted" id="node257"> their kids are going to get shot</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node270">We need to combat institutional racism from top to bottom</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node275">we need major, major reforms in a broken criminal justice system In which we have more people in jail than China</span>. And, <span class="highlighted" id="node280">I intended to tackle that issue</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node285">To make sure that our people have education and jobs rather than jail cells</span>. [applause] <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node306">Governor O'Malley, the question from Arthur was</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node318">do black lives matter </span>, or <span class="highlighted" id="node323">do all lives matter </span>? <br>O'MALLEY: Anderson,<span class="highlighted" id="node336"> the point that the Black Lives Matter movement is making is a very, very legitimate and serious point, and that is that as a nation we have undervalued the lives of black lives, people of color</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node354">When I ran for Mayor of Baltimore — and we we burying over 350 young men ever single year, mostly young, and poor, and black, and I said to our legislature, at the time when I appeared in front of them as a mayor, that if we were burying white, young, poor men in these number we would be marching in the streets and there would be a different reaction</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node359">Black lives matter </span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node364">we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system, and to address race relations in our country</span>. [applause] <br>COOPER: Secretary Clinton, <span class="highlighted" id="node387">what would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't</span>? <br>CLINTON: Well, I think that <span class="highlighted" id="node394">President Obama has been a great moral leader on these issues, and has laid out an agenda that has been obstructed by the Republicans at every turn</span>, so... [applause] ...So,<span class="highlighted" id="node399"> what we need to be doing is not only reforming criminal justice — I have talked about that at some length, including things like body cameras, but we also need to be following the recommendations of the commissioner that President Obama empanelled on policing</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node416">There is an agenda there that we need to be following up on</span>. <br>Similarly, <span class="highlighted" id="node427">we need to tackle mass incarceration, and this may be the only bi-partisan issue in the congress this year</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node434">We actually have people on both sides of the aisle who have reached the same conclusion, that we can not keep imprisoning more people than anybody else in the world</span>. <br>But, I believe that <span class="highlighted" id="node445">the debate, and the discussion has to go further</span>, Anderson, because <span class="highlighted" id="node450">we've got to do more about the lives of these children</span>. That's why I started off by saying <span class="highlighted" id="node463">we need to be committed to making it possible for every child to live up to his or her god given potential</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node473">That is... <br>COOPER: ...<span class="highlighted" id="node468">Thank you, Senator</span>... <br>CLINTON: ...really hard to do if you don't have early childhood education... <br>COOPER: Senator... <br>CLINTON: ...if you don't have schools that are able to meet the needs of the people</span>, or <span class="highlighted" id="node478">good housing, there's a long list</span>... [applause] ...<span class="highlighted" id="node483">We need a new New Deal for communities of color</span>... <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node509">Senator Webb</span>? <br>WEBB: <span class="highlighted" id="node516">I hope I can get that kind of time here</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node523">As a President of the United States, every life in this country matters</span>. At the same time, I believe I can say to you, <span class="highlighted" id="node530">I have had a long history of working with the situation of African Americans</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node535">We're talking about criminal justice reform</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node546">I risked my political life raising the issue of criminal justice reform when I ran for the Senate in Virginia in 2006</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node557"> I had democratic party political consultants telling me I was committing political suicide</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node570">We led that issue in the congress</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node577"> We started a national debate on it</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node592">it wasn't until then that the Republican Party started joining in</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node599">I also represented a so-called war criminal, an African American Marine who was wounded — who was convicted of murder in Vietnam, for six years</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node604">He took his life three years into this</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node609">I cleared his name after — after three years</span>. <br>
