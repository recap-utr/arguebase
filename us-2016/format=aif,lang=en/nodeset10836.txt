KELLY: <span class="highlighted" id="node2">Dr. Carson, a question to you about God and his role</span>, but also, <span class="highlighted" id="node3">one of the issues that the public was very interested in, and we touched on it earlier, is race relations in this country, and how divided we seem right now</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node4">what, if anything, you can do -- you would do as the next president to help heal that divide</span>. <br><br>CARSON: Well, I think <span class="highlighted" id="node22">the bully pulpit is a wonderful place to start healing that divide</span>. You know,<span class="highlighted" id="node29"> we have the purveyors of hatred who take every single incident between people of two races and try to make a race war out of it, and drive wedges into people</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node37">And <span class="highlighted" id="node38">this does not need to be done</span></span>. <br>What we need to think about instead -- you know, <span class="highlighted" id="node45">I was asked by an NPR reporter once, why don't I talk about race that often</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node52">I said it's because I'm a neurosurgeon</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node59">she thought that was a strange response</span>. And you say -- <span class="highlighted" id="node66">I said, you see, when I take someone to the operating room, I'm actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node74">The skin doesn't make them who they are</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node79">The hair doesn't make them who they are</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node84">it's time for us to move beyond that</span>. [applause] <br>Because...[applause]...<span class="highlighted" id="node89">our strength as a nation comes in our unity</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node129">We are the United States of America, not the divided states</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node111">those who want to destroy us are trying to divide us</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node116">we shouldn't let them do it</span>. [applause] <br><br>
