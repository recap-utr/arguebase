BASH : All right . [ applause ] SANDERS : I think <span id="node356" class="highlighted">the president is trying very hard to thread a tough needle here</span> , and <span id="node363" class="highlighted">that is to support those people who are against Assad , against ISIS , without getting us on the ground there </span>, and <span id="node370" class="highlighted">that 's the direction I believe we should have</span> ( inaudible ) .

[ crosstalk ] COOPER : <span id="node435" class="highlighted">Secretary Clinton voted to authorize military force in Iraq , supported more troops in Afghanistan</span> . <span id="node443" class="highlighted">As Secretary of State , she wanted to arm Syrian rebels and push for the bombing of Libya</span> . <span id="node448" class="highlighted">Is she too quick to use military force ?</span> O'MALLEY : Anderson , <span id="node465" class="highlighted">no president — no commander in chief — should take the military option off the table , even if most of us would agree that it should be the last option</span> . What disturbed people so much about — and I would agree with Senator Sanders on this — <span id="node483" class="highlighted">leading us into Iraq under false pretenses and telling us , as a people , that there were weapons of mass destruction there was — was one of the worst blunders in modern American history</span> .

COOPER : Does she — <span id="node544" class="highlighted">does she want to use military force too rapidly ?</span> O'MALLEY : I believe that , <span id="node556" class="highlighted">as president , I would not be so quick to pull for a military tool</span> . I believe that <span id="node567" class="highlighted">a no-fly zone in Syria , at this time , actually , Secretary , would be a mistake</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node628">You have to enforce no-fly zones</span> , and I believe , <span class="highlighted" id="node644">especially with the Russian air force in the air , it could lead to an escalation</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node657">because of an accident that we would deeply regret</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node668">I support President Obama</span> .
