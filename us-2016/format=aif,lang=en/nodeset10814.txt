COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">Governor O'Malley, the concern of voters about you is that you tout our record as Baltimore's mayor</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node6">As we all know, we all saw it</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node11">That city exploded in riots and violence in April</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node16">The current top prosecutor in Baltimore, also a Democrat, blames your zero tolerance policies for sowing the seeds of unrest</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node21">Why should Americans trust you with the country when they see what's going on in the city that you ran for more than seven years</span>? <br><span class="highlighted" id="node26">O'MALLEY:</span> Yes, actually, I believe <span class="highlighted" id="node60">what she said was that there's a lot of policies that have led to this unrest</span>. <br>But, <span class="highlighted" id="node71">Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore in 1999</span>... <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node78">She actually — just for the record, when she was asked which policies, to name two, she said zero tolerance</span>. I mean,<span class="highlighted" id="node89"> there's a number of old policies that we're seeing the results of</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node94">That distress of communities, where communities don't want to step forward and say who killed a 3-year-old</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node99">it's a direct result of these failed policies</span>. <br>O'MALLEY: Well, <span class="highlighted" id="node110">let's talk about this a little bit</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node117">One of the things that was not reported during that heartbreaking night of unrest in Baltimore was that arrests had actually fallen to a 38-year low in the year prior to the Freddie Gray's tragic death</span>. <br>Anderson, <span class="highlighted" id="node123">when I ran for mayor of Baltimore back in 1999, it was not because our city was doing well</span>. It was because <span class="highlighted" id="node128">we allowed ourselves to become the most violent, addicted, and abandoned city in America</span>. <br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node139">I ran and promised people that together we could turn that around</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node144">we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime, or part one (ph) crime by more than any other major city in America over the next 10 years</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node149">I did not make our city immune to setbacks</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node154">I attended a lot of funerals, including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor African-American neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node159">We've saved over a thousand lives in Baltimore in the last 15 years of people working together</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node164">the vast majority of them were young and poor and black</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node169">It wasn't easy on any day</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node174">we saved lives and we gave our city a better future, improving police and community relations every single day that I was in office</span>. <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node218">In one year alone, though, 100,000 arrests were made in your city, a city of 640,000 people</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node228">The ACLU, the NAACP sued you, sued the city, and the city actually settled, saying a lot of those arrests were without probable cause</span>. <br>O'MALLEY: Well, I think <span class="highlighted" id="node235">the key word in your followup there was the word "settle."</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node240">That's true. It was settled</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node245">Arrests peaked in 2003, Anderson, but they declined every year after that </span>as <span class="highlighted" id="node250">we restored peace in our poorer neighborhoods so that people could actually walk and not have to worry about their kids or their loved ones of being victims of violent crime</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node261">Look, none of this is easy</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node266">None of us has all the answers</span>. But<span class="highlighted" id="node271"> together as a city, we saved a lot of lives</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node276">It was about leadership</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node281">It was about principle</span><span class="highlighted" id="node293">. And</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node286"><span class="highlighted" id="node292">it was about bringing people together</span></span>. <br>
