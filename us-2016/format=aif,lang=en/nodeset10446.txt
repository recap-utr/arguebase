COOPER : <span class="highlighted" id="node1">Senator Sanders , are you tougher on — on climate change than Secretary Clinton </span>? <br><br>SANDERS
 : Well , <span class="highlighted" id="node7">I will tell you this</span> . I believe — and <span class="highlighted" id="node14">Pope Francis made this 
point</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node21">This is a moral issue</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node32">The scientists are telling us that we 
need to move extremely boldly</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node37">I am proud that , along with Senator 
Barbara Boxer , a few years ago , we introduced the first piece of 
climate change legislation which called for a tax on carbon</span> . And let me
 also tell you that <span class="highlighted" id="node48">nothing is gonna happen unless we are prepared to 
deal with campaign finance reform</span> , because <span class="highlighted" id="node53">the fossil fuel industry is 
funding the Republican Party , which denies the reality of climate 
change</span> ... [ applause ] ... and <span class="highlighted" id="node62">certainly is not prepared to go forward 
aggressively</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node69">This is a moral issue</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node76">We have got to be extremely 
aggressive in working with China , India , Russia</span> . <br><br>COOPER : <span class="highlighted" id="node81">Senator — thank you , Senator</span> . <br><br>SANDERS : The planet — <span class="highlighted" id="node88">the future of the planet is at stake</span> . <br><br>COOPER : <span class="highlighted" id="node99">Secretary Clinton , I want you to be able to respond , then I 'm gonna go to</span> ( ph ) ( inaudible ) . <br><br>CLINTON
 : Well , that — <span class="highlighted" id="node104">that 's exactly what I 've been doing</span> . When <span class="highlighted" id="node109">we met in 
Copenhagen in 2009 and , literally , President Obama and I were hunting 
for the Chinese , going throughout this huge convention center</span> , because
 <span class="highlighted" id="node120">we knew we had to get them to agree to something</span> . Because <span class="highlighted" id="node131">there will 
be no effective efforts against climate change unless China and India 
join with the rest of the world</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node142">They told us they 'd left for the 
airport</span> ; <span class="highlighted" id="node147">we found out they were having a secret meeting</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node164">We marched up</span>
 , <span class="highlighted" id="node175">we broke in</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node182">we said , `` We 've been looking all over for you . Let
 's sit down and talk about what we need to do . ''</span> And <span class="highlighted" id="node195">we did come up 
with the first international agreement that China has signed</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node200">Thanks to
 President Obama 's leadership , it 's now gone much further</span> . <br><br>COOPER : <span class="highlighted" id="node205">Thank you</span> . <br><br>CLINTON
 : And I do think that <span class="highlighted" id="node212">the bilateral agreement that President Obama made
 with the Chinese was significant</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node219">Now , it needs to go further</span> , and 
<span class="highlighted" id="node224">there will be an international meeting at the end of this year</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node229">we 
must get verifiable commitments to fight climate change from every 
country gathered there</span> . <br><br>COOPER : <span class="highlighted" id="node234">Dana Bash</span> ? <br><br>
