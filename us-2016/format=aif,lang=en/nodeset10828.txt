KELLY: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">Gentlemen, our first round of questions is on the subject of electability in the general election, and we start tonight with you, Dr. Carson</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node6">You are a successful neurosurgeon</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node11">you admit that you have had to study up on foreign policy, saying there's a lot to learn</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node16">Your critics say that your inexperience shows</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node21">You've suggested that the Baltic States are not a part of NATO</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node26"> just months ago you were unfamiliar with the major political parties and government in Israel</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node31">domestically, you thought Alan Greenspan had been treasury secretary instead of federal reserve chair</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node36">Aren't these basic mistakes, and don't they raise legitimate questions about whether you are ready to be president</span>? <br>CARSON: Well, <span class="highlighted" id="node63">I could take issue with -- with all of those things</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node68">we don't have time</span>. <br>But I will say, <span class="highlighted" id="node81">we have a debate here tonight, and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas, and I'm looking very much forward to demonstrating that</span>, in fact, <span class="highlighted" id="node86">the thing that is probably most important is having a brain, and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly</span>. <br>So, you know, <span class="highlighted" id="node93">experience comes from a large number of different arenas</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node98">America became a great nation early </span>on not because <span class="highlighted" id="node103">it was flooded with politicians</span>, but because <span class="highlighted" id="node108">it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node121">that's what will get us on the right track now</span>, as well. <br>WALLACE: Senator Rubio, when Jeb Bush announced his candidacy for presidency, he said this: "There's no passing off responsibility when you're a governor, no blending into the legislative crowd." <br><span class="highlighted" id="node157">Could you please address Governor Bush across the stage here, and explain to him why you, someone who has never held executive office</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node164">are better prepared to be president than he is</span>, a man who you say did a great job running your state of Florida for eight years. <br>RUBIO: Well, thank you for the question, Chris, and it's great to be here tonight. Let me begin by saying this: <span class="highlighted" id="node190">I'm not new to the political process</span>; <span class="highlighted" id="node201">I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node212">I would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node223">It's important to be qualified</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node228">if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's gonna be the next president</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node233">she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node260">Here's what this election better be about: This election better be about the future, not the past</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node265">It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node270">This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node275">You know, the largest retailer in the country and the world today, Amazon, doesn't even own a single store</span>? And <span class="highlighted" id="node280">these changes have been disruptive</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node285">They have changed people's lives</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node290">The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don't pay enough or they are gone</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node295">we need someone that understands that as our nominee</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node348">If I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck</span>? I<span class="highlighted" id="node353"> was raised paycheck to paycheck</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node364">How is she -- how is she gonna lecture me -- how is she gonna lecture me about student loans</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node369">I owed over $100,000 just four years ago</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node380">If I'm our nominee, we will be the party of the future</span>.

You say <span class="highlighted" id="node405">you have a life experience uniquely your own. Not your father's, not your brother's</span>. <br>But <span class="highlighted" id="node422">there are several opponents on this stage who get big- applause lines in early voting states with this line: quote, "the last thing the country needs is another Bush in the Oval Office."</span> <br>So <span class="highlighted" id="node429">do you understand the real concern in this country about dynastic politics</span>? <br>BUSH: <span class="highlighted" id="node434">Absolutely, I do</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node447">I'm gonna run hard, run with heart, and run to win</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node452">I'm gonna have to earn this</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node457">Maybe the barrier -- the bar's even higher for me</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node462">That's fine</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node475">I've got a record in Florida</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node480">I'm proud of my dad, and I'm certainly proud of my brother</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node485">In Florida, they called me Jeb</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node490">I earned it</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node515">I cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node526">We were -- we had -- we balanced every budget</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node537">We went from $1 billion of reserves to $9 billion of reserve</span>s. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node550">We were one of two states that went to AAA bond rating</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node561">They keep -- they called me Veto Corleone</span>.

[applause] <br>KELLY: Mr. Trump, <span class="highlighted" id="node630">one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don't use a politician's filter</span>. However, <span class="highlighted" id="node635">that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node640">You've called women you don't like "fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.</span>" [laughter] Your Twitter account... <br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node645">Only Rosie O'Donnell</span>.
