BAIER : Many questions to come . [ applause ] <span class="highlighted" id="node1">Governor Huckabee , on Facebook , John Pietricone asked this , `` Will you abolish or take away the powers and cut the size of the EPA , the IRS , the Department of Education ? ''</span> Now , broadly ... [ applause ] ... broadly , <span class="highlighted" id="node12">the size of government is a big concern for Facebook users</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node17">Facebook persons</span> , as well as , <span class="highlighted" id="node28">obviously , conservatives</span> . But <span class="highlighted" id="node38">year after year , decade after decade , there are promises from Republicans to shrink government</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node45">But year after year , decade after decade , it does n't happen</span> . In fact ,<span class="highlighted" id="node54"> it gets bigger , even under Republican politicians</span> . So the question is , at this point , <span class="highlighted" id="node60">is the government simply too big for any one person , even a Republican , to shrink ?</span> <br><br>HUCKABEE : <span class="highlighted" id="node81">It 's not too big to shrink</span> . But <span class="highlighted" id="node90">the problem is we have a Wall Street-to-Washington axis of power that has controlled the political climate</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node95">The donor class feeds the political class who does the dance that the donor class wants</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node112">the result is federal government keeps getting bigger</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node124">Every person on this stage who has been a governor will tell that you the biggest fight they had was not the other party</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node129">Wasn't even the legislature</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node134">It was the federal government</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node135">who continually put mandates on the states that we had to suck up and pay for</span> . And the fact is <span class="highlighted" id="node144">there are a lot of things happening at the federal level that are absolutely beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution </span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node149">This is power that should be shifted back to the states</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node150">whether it 's the EPA , there is no role at the federal level for the Department of Education</span> . [ cheering and applause ] And<span class="highlighted" id="node151"> I 'm still one who says that we can get rid of the Internal Revenue Service if we would pass the FairTax</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node152">which is a tax on consumption rather than a tax on people 's income</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node153">move power back where the founders believed it should have been all along</span> . <br><br>BAIER : Dr. Carson ... <br><br>UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Bret , Bret , Bret ... <br><br>BAIER : <span class="highlighted" id="node174">Dr. Carson , do you agree with that?</span> <br><br>CARSON : <span class="highlighted" id="node209">What I agree with is that we need a significantly changed taxation system</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node214">the one that I've advocated is based on tithing</span> , because I think <span class="highlighted" id="node215">God is a pretty fair guy</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node235">he said , you know , if you give me a tithe , it doesn't matter how much you made</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node249">If you've had a bumper crop , you do n't owe me triple tithes</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node250">if you 've had no crops at all , you don't owe me no tithes</span> . So <span class="highlighted" id="node267">there must be something inherently fair about that</span> . And that 's why <span class="highlighted" id="node300">I 've advocated a proportional tax system </span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node311"> You make $ 10 billion , you pay a billion</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node312">You make $ 10 , you pay one</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node313">everybody gets treated the same way</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node326">you get rid of the deductions , you get rid of all the loopholes</span> , and ... [ timer sounds ] <br><br>BAIER : Governor Bush ? <br><br>CARSON : And <span class="highlighted" id="node331">I have a lot more to say about it</span> . <br><br>BAIER : We 're going to come back to you , Dr. Carson .<span class="highlighted" id="node336"> Governor Bush , you are one of the few people on the stage who advocates for Common Core education standards , reading and math</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node341">A lot of people on this stage vigorously oppose a federal involvement in education</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node346">They say it should all be handled locally</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node355">President Obama 's secretary of education , Arnie Duncan , has said that most of the criticism of Common Core is due to a , quote , `` fringe group of critics</span> . '' <span class="highlighted" id="node364">Do you think that 's accurate ?</span> <br><br>BUSH : <span class="highlighted" id="node369">No , I don't</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node382">I don't believe the federal government should be involved in the creation of standards directly or indirectly</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node383">the creation of curriculum or content</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node384">It is clearly a state responsibility</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node385">I'm for higher standards ... [ applause ] ... measured in an intellectually honest way , with abundant school choice , ending social promotion</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node386">I know how to do this</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node387">as governor of the state of Florida I created the first statewide voucher program in the country</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node390">the second statewide voucher program , in the country</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node391">the third statewide voucher program in the country</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node392">we had rising student achievement across the board</span> , because <span class="highlighted" id="node393">high standards</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node396">robust accountability</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node399">ending social promotion in third grade</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node402">real school choice across the board</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node405">challenging the teachers union</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node406">beating them is the way to go</span> . And<span class="highlighted" id="node413"> Florida 's low income kids had the greatest gains inside the country</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node416">Our graduation rate improved by 50 percent</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node419">That 's what I 'm for</span> . <br><br>BAIER : <span class="highlighted" id="node420">Senator Rubio , why is Governor Bush wrong on Common Core ? </span><br><br>RUBIO : Well , first off , <span class="highlighted" id="node559">I too believe in curriculum reform</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node564">It is critically important in the 21st Century</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node569">We do need curriculum reform</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node580">it should happen at the state and local level</span> . That 's . . . that 's . . . <span class="highlighted" id="node589">that is where educational policy belongs</span> , because <span class="highlighted" id="node590">if a parent is unhappy with what their child is being taught in school, they can go to that local school board or their state legislature, or their governor and get it changed</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node593">Here 's the problem with Common Core</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node594">The Department of Education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node595">They will not stop with it being a suggestion</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node596">They will turn it into a mandate</span> . In fact , <span class="highlighted" id="node597">what they will begin to say to local communities is, you will not get federal money unless do you things the way we want you to do it </span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node606">they will use Common Core or any other requirements that exists nationally to force it down the throats of our people in our states</span> . [ applause ] <br><br>BAIER : <span class="highlighted" id="node617">And do you agree with your old friend ?</span> <br><br>BUSH : <span class="highlighted" id="node680">He is definitely my friend</span> . And I think <span class="highlighted" id="node685">the states ought to create these standards</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node690">if states want to opt out of Common Core , fine</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node695">Just make sure your standards are high</span> . Because today in America, <span class="highlighted" id="node700">a third of our kids, after we spend more per student than any country in the world other than a couple rounding errors, to be honest with you , 30 percent are college- and/or career-ready</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node701">If we are going to compete in this world we 're in today , there is no possible way we can do it with lowering expectations and dumbing down everything</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node714">Children are going to suffer </span>and <span class="highlighted" id="node715">families' hearts are going to be broken</span> that <span class="highlighted" id="node724">their kids wo n't be able to get a job in the 21st Century </span>.
