BASH: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">Secretary Clinton, you now support mandated paid family leave</span>. <br>CLINTON: <span class="highlighted" id="node6">Mm-hmm</span>. <br>BASH: <span class="highlighted" id="node15">Carly Fiorina, the first female CEO of a Fortune 50 company</span>, argues,<span class="highlighted" id="node22"> if the government requires paid leave, it will force small businesses to, quote, "hire fewer people and create fewer jobs."</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node37">What do you say not only to Carly Fiorina, but also a small-business owner out there who says, you know, I like this idea, but I just can't afford it</span>? <br>CLINTON: Well, <span class="highlighted" id="node44">I'm surprised she says that</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node55">California has had a paid leave program for a number of years</span>. And it's... <br>BASH: <span class="highlighted" id="node66">It's on the federal level</span>. <br>CLINTON: Well, but all — well, <span class="highlighted" id="node77">on a state level, a state as big as many countries in the world</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node88">it has not had the ill effects that the Republicans are always saying it will have</span>. And I think this is — <span class="highlighted" id="node99">this is typical Republican scare tactics</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node104">We can design a system and pay for it that does not put the burden on small businesses</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node132">I remember as a young mother, you know, having a baby wake up who was sick and I'm supposed to be in court, because I was practicing law</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node137">I know what it's like</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node121">I think we need to recognize the incredible challenges that so many parents face, particularly working moms</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node154">I see my good friend, Senator Gillibrand, in the front row</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node161">She's been a champion of this</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node166">We need to get a consensus through this campaign</span>, which is why <span class="highlighted" id="node173">I'm talking about it everywhere I go</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node178">we need to join the rest of the advanced world in having it</span>. <br>BASH: But Secretary — Secretary Clinton, <span class="highlighted" id="node197">even many people who agree with you might say, look, this is very hard to do, especially in today's day and age</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node202">There are so many people who say, "Really? Another government program? Is that what you're proposing? And at the expense of taxpayer money?</span>" <br>CLINTON: Well, look, you know, <span class="highlighted" id="node219">when people say that — it's always the Republicans or their sympathizers who say, "You can't have paid leave, you can't provide health care."</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node234">They don't mind having big government to interfere with a woman's right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node239">They're fine with big government when it comes to that</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node244">I'm sick of it</span>. [applause] <br>You know, <span class="highlighted" id="node249">we can do these things</span>. [applause] <br>We should not be paralyzed — <span class="highlighted" id="node254">we should not be paralyzed by the Republicans and their constant refrain, "big government this, big government that," that except for what they want to impose on the American people</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node259">I know we can afford it</span>, because<span class="highlighted" id="node264"> we're going to make the wealthy pay for it</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node269">That is the way to get it done</span>. <br>COOPER: Thank you. <span class="highlighted" id="node316">Senator Sanders</span>? <br>SANDERS: Yeah, Dana, here's the point: <span class="highlighted" id="node323">Every other major country on Earth, every one, including some small countries, say that when a mother has a baby, she should stay home with that baby</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node328">We are the only major country</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node333">That is an international embarrassment that we do not provide family — paid family and medical leave</span>. [applause] <br>Second of all, <span class="highlighted" id="node352">the secretary is right</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node361">Republicans tell us we can't do anything except give tax breaks to billionaires and cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node372">That's not what the American people want</span>. <br>COOPER: <span class="highlighted" id="node384">Governor O'Malley</span>? <br>O'MALLEY: Anderson, <span class="highlighted" id="node379">in our state, we actually expanded family leave</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node397"> And I have to agree with Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders</span>. Look, <span class="highlighted" id="node402">the genius of our nation is that we find ways in every generation to include more of our people more fully in the economic life of our country</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node407">we need to do that for our families</span>, and especially so that <span class="highlighted" id="node412">women aren't penalized in having to drop out of the workforce</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node439">My wife, Katie, is here with our four kids</span>. And, man, <span class="highlighted" id="node444">that was a juggle when we had little kids and — and keeping jobs and moving forwards</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node449">We would be a stronger nation economically if we had paid family leave</span>. <br>COOPER: Governor, thank you. <span class="highlighted" id="node470">The issue now, particularly in this state, is recreational marijuana</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node475"> I want to go to Juan Carlos Lopez</span>. <br><br>
