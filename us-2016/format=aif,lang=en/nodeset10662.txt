HOLT : Secretary Clinton ? TRUMP : Wait . The AFL-CIO the other day , behind the blue screen ,<span class="highlighted" id="node18"> I do n't know who you were talking to</span> , Secretary Clinton , but you were totally out of control . <span class="highlighted" id="node11">I said , there 's a person with a temperament that 's got a problem</span>.<br><br><div>HOLT : Secretary Clinton ? <br><br>CLINTON : Whew , OK. [ laughter ] <span class="highlighted" id="node33">Let 's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node40">first , NATO</span> . You know , <span class="highlighted" id="node47">NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node54">basically it says this : An attack on one is an attack on all</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node65">you know the only time it 's ever been invoked ?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node72">After 9/11 , when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node79">something that they still are doing by our side</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node91">With respect to Iran , when I became secretary of state , Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node98">They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node105">They had built covert facilities</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node112">They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away</span>.And <span class="highlighted" id="node129">we had sanctioned them</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node140">I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate</span> , but <span class="highlighted" id="node147">it was n't enough</span> . So <span class="highlighted" id="node154">I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran</span>.And<span class="highlighted" id="node166"> we did drive them to the negotiating table</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node175">my successor , John Kerry , and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran 's nuclear program without firing a single shot</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node182">That 's diplomacy</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node189">That 's coalition-building</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node196">That 's working with other nations</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node208">The other day , I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran , and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node219">He said , you know , if they taunted our sailors , I 'd blow them out of the water and start another war</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node230">That 's not good judgment</span>.<br><br>TRUMP : <span class="highlighted" id="node241">That would not start a war</span>.<br><br>CLINTON : <span class="highlighted" id="node248">That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief , to be taunted</span> . And the worst part ... <br><br>TRUMP : <span class="highlighted" id="node275">No</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node282">they were taunting us</span>.<br><br>CLINTON : ... <span class="highlighted" id="node293">of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node300">He has said repeatedly that he did n't care if other nations got nuclear weapons , Japan , South Korea , even Saudi Arabia</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node311">It has been the policy of the United States , Democrats and Republicans , to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node322">He even said , well , you know , if there were nuclear war in East Asia , well , you know , that 's fine</span> ... <br><br>TRUMP : <span class="highlighted" id="node337">Wrong</span>.<br><br>CLINTON : ... <span class="highlighted" id="node348">have a good time , folks</span>.<br><br>TRUMP : <span class="highlighted" id="node364">It 's lies</span>.<br><br>CLINTON : And , <span class="highlighted" id="node377">in fact , his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node388">That is the number-one threat we face in the world</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node399">it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material</span> . So <span class="highlighted" id="node414">a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node425">as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned</span>.<br><br>TRUMP : <span class="highlighted" id="node432">That line 's getting a little bit old , I must say</span> . I would like to ... <br><br>CLINTON : <span class="highlighted" id="node439">It 's a good one , though </span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node448">It well describes the problem</span> . [ laughter ] <br><br>TRUMP : <span class="highlighted" id="node459">It 's not an accurate one at all</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node464">It 's not an accurate one</span> . So <span class="highlighted" id="node485">I just want to give a lot of things</span>—and <span class="highlighted" id="node493">just to respond</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node502">I agree with her on one thing</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node509">The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament , nuclear weapons</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node530">like you think</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node535">your—your president thinks</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node548">Nuclear is the single greatest threat</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node562">Just to go down the list , we defend Japan , we defend Germany , we defend South Korea , we defend Saudi Arabia , we defend countries</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node569">They do not pay us</span> . But <span class="highlighted" id="node576">they should be paying us</span> , because <span class="highlighted" id="node583">we are providing tremendous service</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node594">we 're losing a fortune</span> . That 's why <span class="highlighted" id="node606">we 're losing</span>—<span class="highlighted" id="node631">we 're losing</span>—<span class="highlighted" id="node633">we lose on everything</span> . I say , who makes these—<span class="highlighted" id="node638"><span class="highlighted" id="node668">we lose on everything</span></span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node651">All I said , that it 's very possible that <span class="highlighted" id="node717">if they do n't pay a fair share</span></span> , because <span class="highlighted" id="node656"><span class="highlighted" id="node722">this is n't 40 years ago where we could do what we 're doing</span></span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node747">We ca n't defend Japan , a behemoth , selling us cars by the million</span> ... <br></div>
