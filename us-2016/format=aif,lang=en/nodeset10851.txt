HOLT: Secretary Clinton, last week, you said <span class="highlighted" id="node1">we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node10">Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people</span>?<br>CLINTON: Lester, I think <span class="highlighted" id="node15">implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police</span>. I think, unfortunately, <span class="highlighted" id="node28">too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other</span>. And therefore, I think <span class="highlighted" id="node33">we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way</span>?<br>But <span class="highlighted" id="node43">when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences</span>, I have said, <span class="highlighted" id="node48">in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers</span>.<br>I've <span class="highlighted" id="node53">met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node58">They admit it's an issue</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node63">They've got a lot of concerns</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node68">Mental health is one of the biggest concerns</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node73">now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street</span>.<br><span class="highlighted" id="node78">They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance</span>. And I think <span class="highlighted" id="node83">the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that</span>. <br>HOLT: <span class="highlighted" id="node124">Mr. Trump</span>...<br><span class="highlighted" id="node132">TRUMP</span>: <span class="highlighted" id="node131">I'd like to respond to that</span>.<br>HOLT: <span class="highlighted" id="node137">Please</span>.<br>TRUMP: First of all, <span class="highlighted" id="node148">I agree</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node153">a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node158">I agree with you</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node163">When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node189">I have the endorsement of the NRA</span>, which <span class="highlighted" id="node194">I'm very proud of</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node173"> These are very, very good people</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node178">they're protecting the Second Amendment</span>.<br>But I think <span class="highlighted" id="node212">we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node217">when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node222">I tend to agree with that quite strongly</span>.<br>I do want to bring up the fact that <span class="highlighted" id="node232">you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node237">that's a term that I think was a—it's—it's been horribly met</span>, as you know. I think <span class="highlighted" id="node242">you've apologized for it</span>. But I think <span class="highlighted" id="node247">it was a terrible thing to say</span>.<br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node262">when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away</span>. Well, <span class="highlighted" id="node267">I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them</span>. And I don't think—<span class="highlighted" id="node272">I really don't think you disagree with me on this</span>, if you want to know the truth.<br>I think <span class="highlighted" id="node277">maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe</span>—<span class="highlighted" id="node282">in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node287">Five hundred murders is a lot of murders</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node292">It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good</span>?<br>But<span class="highlighted" id="node303"> we went from 2,200 to 500</span>. And<span class="highlighted" id="node308"> it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node313">it was terminated by current mayor</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node318">stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node323">Tremendous beyond belief</span>. So when you say <span class="highlighted" id="node334">it has no impact</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node343">it really did</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node348">It had a very, very big impact</span>.<br>CLINTON: Well, it's also fair to say, <span class="highlighted" id="node447">if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node463">So there is.</span>..<br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node457">No</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node462"><span class="highlighted" id="node500">you're wrong</span></span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node504">You're wrong</span>.<br><span class="highlighted" id="node483">CLINTON</span>: No, <span class="highlighted" id="node478">I'm not</span>.<br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node473">Murders are up</span>. All right. <span class="highlighted" id="node525">You check it</span>.<br>CLINTON: New York—<span class="highlighted" id="node538">New York has done an excellent job</span>. And I give credit—<span class="highlighted" id="node543">I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node548">it has worked</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node567">other communities need to come together to do what will work</span>, as well.<br>Look, <span class="highlighted" id="node576">one murder is too many</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node581">it is important that we learn about what has been effective</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node586">not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node591">Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe</span>?<br>But let's also add, <span class="highlighted" id="node596">no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods</span>. And so <span class="highlighted" id="node601">we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem</span>.<br>HOLT: <span class="highlighted" id="node634">This conversation is about race</span>. And so, <span class="highlighted" id="node639">Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five</span>...<br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node647">I'd like to just respond, if I might.</span><br>HOLT: <span class="highlighted" id="node652">Please—20 second</span>s.<br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node657">I'd just like to respond</span>.<br>HOLT: <span class="highlighted" id="node677">Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you</span>.<br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node684">I will</span>. Look, <span class="highlighted" id="node693">the African-American community has been let down by our politicians</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node698">They talk good around election time, like right now</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node703">after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years</span>.<br>The <span class="highlighted" id="node718">African-American community—because—look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node729">They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node734">that's what it is</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node745">They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years</span>.<br>HOLT: <span class="highlighted" id="node762">Mr. Trump, let me</span>...<br>[crosstalk]<br>CLINTON: <span class="highlighted" id="node767">Well, I—I do think</span>...<br>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node782">And I will tell you</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node776">you look at the inner cities</span>—and <span class="highlighted" id="node781">I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just—you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node787">You decided to stay home, and that's OK</span>. But I will tell you, <span class="highlighted" id="node792">I've been all over</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node810">I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node815">they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done</span>.<br>HOLT: <span class="highlighted" id="node832">Mr. Trump, I</span>...<br>CLINTON: I think—I think—I think <span class="highlighted" id="node840">Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate</span>. And, <span class="highlighted" id="node845">yes, I did</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node850">you know what else I prepared for</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node855">I prepared to be president</span>. And I think<span class="highlighted" id="node860"> that's a good thing</span>. [applause]<br>
