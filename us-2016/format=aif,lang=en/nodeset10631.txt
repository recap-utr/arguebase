I think <span class="highlighted" id="node617">we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize , even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere</span>.But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and <span class="highlighted" id="node628">eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node633">end their claim of being a Caliphate</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node638">We 're making progress</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node643">Our military is assisting in Iraq</span> .
