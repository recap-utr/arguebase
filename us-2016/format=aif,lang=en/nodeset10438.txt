COOPER : Thanks , sir . WEBB : <span id="node1" class="highlighted">And I put the African American soldier on the Mall</span> . <span id="node28" class="highlighted">I made that recommendation</span> and <span id="node33" class="highlighted">fought for it</span> . So ,<span id="node38" class="highlighted"> if you want someone who is — can stand up in front of you right now and say I have done the hard job , I have taken the risks , I am your person</span> . COOPER : Senator Sanders , let 's talk about income inequality . <span id="node61" class="highlighted">Wages and incomes are flat</span> . <span id="node66" class="highlighted">You 've argued that the gap between rich and poor is wider than at any time since the 1920s </span>. <span id="node71" class="highlighted">We 've had a Democratic president for seven years</span> . <span id="node76" class="highlighted">What are you going to be able to do that President Obama did n't</span> ? <div><br></div><div>SANDERS : Well , first of all , <span id="node81" class="highlighted">let 's remember where we were when Bush left office</span> . <span id="node96" class="highlighted">We were losing 800,000 jobs a month</span> . And I know <span id="node103" class="highlighted">my Republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue</span> , but <span id="node110" class="highlighted">the world 's financial crisis was on</span> — <span id="node120" class="highlighted">the world 's financial markets system was on the verge of collapse</span> . <span id="node125" class="highlighted">That 's where we were</span> . <span id="node130" class="highlighted">Are we better off today than we were then ? </span><span id="node135" class="highlighted">Absolutely</span> . But <span id="node140" class="highlighted">the truth is that for the 40 years , the great middle class of this country has been disappearing</span> . And in my view <span class="highlighted" id="node145">what we need to do is create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure </span>; <span id="node150" class="highlighted">raise the minimum wage to $ 15 an hour</span> ; <span id="node155" class="highlighted">pay equity for women workers</span> ; and<span class="highlighted" id="node755"> our disastrous trade policies</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node762">which have cost us millions of jobs</span> ; and <span id="node165" class="highlighted">make every public college and university in this country tuition free</span> . [ applause ] </div><div><br></div><div>COOPER : Secretary Clinton ... [ crosstalk ] COOPER : I 'll let you jump in a moment . Everybody will get in on this in a moment . Secretary Clinton , how would you address this issue ? <span id="node170" class="highlighted">In all candor , you and your husband are part of the one percent</span> . <span id="node175" class="highlighted">How can you credibly represent the views of the middle class ?</span> </div><div><br></div><div>CLINTON : Well , you know , <span id="node186" class="highlighted">both Bill and I have been very blessed</span> . <span id="node191" class="highlighted">Neither of us came from wealthy families</span> and <span id="node202" class="highlighted">we 've worked really hard our entire lives</span> . And<span class="highlighted" id="node775"> I want to make sure every single person in this country has the same opportunities that he and I have had </span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node783">to make the most of their God-given potential</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node784">to have the chances that they should have in America for a good education , good job training , and then good jobs</span> . <span id="node229" class="highlighted">I have a five point economic plan</span> , because <span id="node234" class="highlighted">this inequality challenge we face</span> , <span id="node241" class="highlighted">we have faced it at other points</span> . <span id="node256" class="highlighted">It 's absolutely right </span>. <span id="node261" class="highlighted">It has n't been this bad since the 1920s</span> . But <span id="node278" class="highlighted">if you look at the Republicans versus the Democrats when it comes to economic policy , there is no comparison</span> . <span id="node283" class="highlighted">The economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House</span> and that 's why<span id="node288" class="highlighted"> we need to have a Democrat in the White House in January 2017</span>. </div><div><br></div><div>COOPER : Governor O'Malley , ( inaudible ) . </div><div><br></div><div>O'MALLEY : Yes . <span class="highlighted" id="node335">Anderson , I want to associate myself with many of the items that the senator from Vermont mentioned </span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node340">I actually did them in our state</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node353">We raised the minimum wage</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node358">passed the living wage</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node359">invested more in infrastructure</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node360">went four years in a row without a penny 's increase in college tuition</span> . But <span class="highlighted" id="node397">there 's another piece that Senator Sanders left out tonight</span> , but <span class="highlighted" id="node404">he 's been excellent about underscoring that</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node411">that is that we need to separate the casino , speculative , mega-bank gambling that we have to insure with our money , from the commercial banking — namely , reinstating Glass-Steagall</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node418">Secretary Clinton mentioned my support eight years ago</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node425">Secretary , I was proud to support you eight years ago</span> , but <span class="highlighted" id="node432">something happened in between</span> , and that is , Anderson , <span class="highlighted" id="node439">a Wall Street crash that wiped out millions of jobs and millions of savings for families</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node446">we are still just as vulnerable Paul Volcker says today </span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node453">We need to reinstate Glass-Steagall </span>and<span class="highlighted" id="node454"> that 's a huge difference on this stage among us as candidates </span>. </div><div><br></div><div>COOPER : Just for viewers at home who may not be reading up on this , Glass-Steagall is the Depression-era banking law repealed in 1999 that prevented commercial banks from engaging in investment banking and insurance activities . <span class="highlighted" id="node467">Secretary Clinton , he raises a fundamental difference on this stage</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node474">Senator Sanders wants to break up the big Wall Street banks</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node483">You don't</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node490">You say charge the banks more</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node501">continue to monitor them</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node510">Why is your plan better ? </span></div><div><br></div><div>CLINTON : Well , <span class="highlighted" id="node519">my plan is more comprehensive</span> . And frankly , <span class="highlighted" id="node520">it 's tougher</span> because of course <span class="highlighted" id="node531">we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node544">We can never let the American taxpayer and middle class families ever have to bail out the kind of speculative behavior that we saw</span> . But <span class="highlighted" id="node551">we also have to worry about some of the other players — AIG , a big insurance company</span> ; <span class="highlighted" id="node559">Lehman Brothers , an investment bank</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node566">There's this whole area called ``shadow banking </span>. '' <span class="highlighted" id="node573">That 's where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from</span>. CLINTON : So <span class="highlighted" id="node591">I 'm with both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley in putting a lot of attention onto the banks</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node602">the plan that I have put forward would actually empower regulators to break up big banks if we thought they posed a risk </span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node607">I want to make sure we 're going to cover everybody</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node608">not what caused the problem last time</span> , but <span class="highlighted" id="node619">what could cause it next time</span> .

[ laughter ] </div><div><br></div><div>COOPER : Why ? </div><div><br></div><div>SANDERS : Let us be clear that<span class="highlighted" id="node712"> the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street, where <span class="highlighted" id="node719">fraud is a business model</span>, helped to destroy this economy</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node690">the lives of millions of people</span> .
