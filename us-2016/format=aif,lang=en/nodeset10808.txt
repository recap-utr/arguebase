COOPER: I'm Anderson Cooper. Thanks for joining us. We've already welcomed the candidates on stage. They are in place at their podiums. Before we dive into the issues, I want to quickly explain some of the groundrules tonight. <br>As the moderator, I'll ask questions, followups and guide the discussion. I'll be joined in the questioning by CNN's Juan Carlos Lopez and Dana Bash, a well as Don Lemon who will share questions from Democrats around the country. Each candidate will get one minute to answer questions, and 30 seconds for followups and rebuttals. I'll give candidates time to respond if they have been singled out for criticism. <br>Our viewers should know that we have lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up. <br>I want the candidates to be able to introduce themselves to our audience. Each candidate will have two minutes to introduce themselves. <br>Let's begin with Governor Chafee. <br>Governor? <br><br>CHAFEE: Thank you, Anderson. <br>Thank you, CNN, and thank you Facebook for organizing this debate. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node104">Not only will Americans be electing a new president next year</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node111">we also will be electing a world leader</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node118">Voters should assess the candidate's experience, character and vision for the future</span> as <span class="highlighted" id="node123">they make this important decision</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node143">I'm the only one running for president that has been a mayor, a United States senator, and a governor</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node150">As mayor, I brought labor peace to my city and kept taxes down</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node157">I was reelected three times</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node164">As a senator, I earned a reputation for courageous votes against the Bush-Cheney tax cuts the favored the wealthy, against the tragedy of the Iraq war, for environmental stewardship, for protection of our civil liberties</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node171">I served on the Foreign Relations Committee and I chaired the Middle East Subcommittee for four years</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node178">As governor, I came in at the depths of the recession and we turned my state around</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node185">Rhode Island had the biggest drop of the unemployment rate over my four budgets of all but one state</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node192">It happens to be Nevada, where we're having this debate</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node199">I'm very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node206">I've always been honest</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node213">I have the courage to take the long-term view, and I've shown good judgment</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node235">I have high ethical standards</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node258">As we look to the future, I want to address the income inequality, close the gap between the haves and the have-nots</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node265">I want to address climate change</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node272">a real threat to our planet</span>.
