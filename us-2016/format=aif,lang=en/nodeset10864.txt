HOLT: Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America's direction. And let's start by talking about race.<br><span class="highlighted" id="node1">The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node6">much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police</span>, as <span class="highlighted" id="node17">we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node28">Race has been a big issue in this campaign</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node33">one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap</span>.<br>So <span class="highlighted" id="node38">how do you heal the divide</span>? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.<br>CLINTON: Well, <span class="highlighted" id="node53">you're right</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node62">Race remains a significant challenge in our country</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node75">Unfortunately, race still determines too much</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node86">often determines where people live</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node97">determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get,</span> and, yes, <span class="highlighted" id="node104">it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node111">We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte</span>.<br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node128">we've got to do several things at the same time</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node141">We have to restore trust between communities and the police</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node152">We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node163">Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law</span>.<br><span class="highlighted" id="node172">Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node177">I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node190">I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system</span>.<br>But <span class="highlighted" id="node199">we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node204">we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node218">we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them</span>.<br><span class="highlighted" id="node229">The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node240">we have to do two things</span>, as I said. <span class="highlighted" id="node251">We have to restore trust</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node267">We have to work with the police</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node272">We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node277">we have to tackle the plague of gun violence</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node282">which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today</span>.<br><br>
