BASH : Can you answer the ... <br><br>SANDERS : ... in order to make it possible for them to afford their education . And <span id="node1" class="highlighted">I want colleges to get their costs down</span> . <span id="node6" class="highlighted">They are outrageously high in what they 're charging</span> . <br><br>BASH : <span id="node11" class="highlighted">Secretary Clinton , the question was not just about tuition</span> , though . <span id="node16" class="highlighted">It was about Senator Sanders ' plan to expand Social Security , to make Medicare available to all Americans</span> . <span id="node21" class="highlighted">Is that something that you would support </span>? And <span id="node26" class="highlighted">if not , why not</span> ? <br><br>CLINTON : Well , <span id="node31" class="highlighted">I fully support Social Security</span> . And <span id="node36" class="highlighted">the most important fight we 're going to have is defending it against continuing Republican efforts to privatize it</span> . <br><br>BASH : <span id="node41" class="highlighted">Do you want to expand it </span>? <br><br>CLINTON : <span id="node46" class="highlighted">I want to enhance the benefits for the poorest recipients of Social Security</span> . <span id="node51" class="highlighted">We have a lot of women on Social Security , particularly widowed and single women who didn't make a lot of money during their careers , and they are impoverished</span> , and <span id="node56" class="highlighted">they need more help from the Social Security system</span> . And I will focus — <span id="node61" class="highlighted">I will focus on helping those people who need it the most</span> . And <span id="node66" class="highlighted">of course I 'm going to defend Social Security</span> . <span id="node71" class="highlighted">I 'm going to look for ways to try to make sure it 's solvent into the future</span> . And <span id="node76" class="highlighted">we also need to talk about health care at some time</span> , because <span id="node81" class="highlighted">we agree on the goals , we just disagree on the means</span> . <br><br>SANDERS : When the Republicans — <span id="node106" class="highlighted">when the Republicans in the Congress and some Democrats were talking about cutting Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans , for the so-called chained CPI , I founded a caucus called the Defending Social Security Caucus</span> . <span id="node111" class="highlighted">My view is that when you have millions of seniors in this country trying to get by — and I do n't know how they do on $ 11,000 , $ 12,000 , $ 13,000 a year — you do n't cut Social Security , you expand it</span> . And <span id="node116" class="highlighted">the way you expand it is by lifting the cap on taxable incomes</span> so that <span id="node121" class="highlighted">you do away with the absurdity of a millionaire paying the same amount into the system as somebody making $ 118,000</span> . <span id="node126" class="highlighted">You do that , Social Security is solvent until 2061 and you can expand benefits</span> .

But <span id="node161" class="highlighted">in 2007 , when Democrats controlled Congress and the Bush White House was onboard , you voted against it</span> . <span id="node166" class="highlighted">Why should Latino voters trust you now</span> when <span id="node171" class="highlighted">you left them at the altar at the moment when reform was very close</span> ? <br><br>SANDERS : <span id="node178" class="highlighted">I didn't leave anybody at the altar</span> . <span id="node183" class="highlighted">I voted against that piece of legislation because it had guest-worker provisions in it which the Southern Poverty Law Center talked about being semi-slavery</span> . <span id="node188" class="highlighted">Guest workers are coming in , they 're working under terrible conditions , but if they stand up for their rights , they 're thrown out of the country</span> . <span id="node193" class="highlighted">I was not the only progressive to vote against that legislation for that reason</span> . <span id="node198" class="highlighted">Tom Harkin , a very good friend of Hillary Clinton 's and mine , one of the leading labor advocates , also voted against that</span> . <br><br>LOPEZ : <span class="highlighted" id="node608">Tom Harkin isn't running for president . You are</span> . <br><br>SANDERS : <span id="node213" class="highlighted">I know that</span> .

My view right now — and always has been — is that when <span id="node223" class="highlighted">you have 11 million undocumented people in this country</span> , <span id="node228" class="highlighted">we need comprehensive immigration reform</span> , <span id="node233" class="highlighted">we need a path toward citizenship</span> , <span id="node238" class="highlighted">we need to take people out of the shadows</span> . <br><br>O'MALLEY : <span id="node243" class="highlighted">And Juan Carlos — Juan Carlos</span> ... <br><br>LOPEZ : <span id="node248" class="highlighted">Secretary Clinton — Secretary Clinton , Governor O'Malley wants to open up Obamacare to millions of undocumented immigrants and their children , including almost 90,000 people right here in Nevada</span> . <span id="node253" class="highlighted">Do you</span> ? <br><br>CLINTON : Well , first of all , <span id="node258" class="highlighted">I want to make sure every child gets health care</span> .

I think that is — <span id="node308" class="highlighted">it raises so many issues</span> . <span id="node313" class="highlighted">It would be very difficult to administer</span> , <span id="node324" class="highlighted">it needs to be part of a comprehensive immigration reform , when we finally do get to it</span> .<br><br>LOPEZ : <span id="node335" class="highlighted">Governor O'Malley</span> ? <br><br>O'MALLEY : Juan Carlos , I think <span id="node340" class="highlighted">what you 've heard up here is some of the old thinking on immigration reform</span> , and that 's why <span id="node345" class="highlighted">it 's gridlocked</span> . <span id="node356" class="highlighted">We need to understand that our country is stronger in every generation by the arrival of new American immigrants</span> .
