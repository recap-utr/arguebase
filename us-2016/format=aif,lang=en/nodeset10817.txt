COOPER: Dana? <div><br>BASH: Thank you. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node255">CNN visited college campuses, along with Facebook</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node260">not surprisingly college affordability was among the most pressing issue</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node6">Senator Sanders, you've mentioned a couple of times you do have a plan to make public colleges free for everyone</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node13">Secretary Clinton has criticized that in saying she's not in favor of making a college free for Donald Trump's kids</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node20">Do you think taxpayers should pick up the tab for wealthy children? </span><br><br></div><div>SANDERS: Well, let me tell you, <span class="highlighted" id="node27">Donald Trump and his billionaire friends under my policies are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes today — taxes in the future than they're paying today</span>. [applause] <br></div><div>But <span class="highlighted" id="node34">in terms of education, this is what I think</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node41">This is the year 2015</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node48">A college degree today, Dana, is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago</span>. <br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node55">what we said 50 years ago and a hundred years ago is that every kid in this country should be able to get a high school education regardless of the income of their family</span>. I think <span class="highlighted" id="node69">we have to say that is true for everybody going to college</span>. <br>I think <span class="highlighted" id="node76">we don't need a complicated system, which the secretary is talking about</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node88">the income goes down</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node95"> the income goes down</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node102">if you're poor you have to work, and so forth and so on</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node109">I pay for my program, by the way, through a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, it will substantially lower interest rates on college debt, a major crisis in this country</span>. [applause] <br><br></div><div>BASH: And, <span class="highlighted" id="node116">Secretary Clinton, it's not just college tuition that Senator Sanders is talking about, expanding Social Security and giving all Americans Medicare</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node123">What's wrong with that?</span> </div><div><br>CLINTON: Well, <span class="highlighted" id="node130">let me address college affordability</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node137">I have a plan that I think will really zero in on what the problems are</span>. First, <span class="highlighted" id="node148"><span class="highlighted" id="node149">all the 40 million Americans who currently have student debt will be able to refinance their debt to a low interest rate</span></span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node156">That will save thousands of dollars for people who are now struggling under this cumbersome, burdensome college debt</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node163">As a young student in Nevada said to me, the hardest thing about going to college should not be paying for it</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node170">then we have to make it more affordable</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node181">How do we make it more affordable?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node188">My plan would enable anyone to go to a public college or university tuition free</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node195">You would not have to borrow money for tuition</span>. <br>But I do believe — and <span class="highlighted" id="node202">maybe it's because I worked when I went through college</span>; <span class="highlighted" id="node209">I worked when I went through law school</span> — I think <span class="highlighted" id="node216">it's important for everybody to have some part of getting this accomplished</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node233">That's why I call it a compact</span>. <br>BASH: Secretary Clinton... <br>CLINTON: But, <span class="highlighted" id="node238">yes, I would like students to work 10 hours a week</span>... <br></div>
