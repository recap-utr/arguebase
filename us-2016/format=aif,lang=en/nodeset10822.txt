COOPER: All right. Time for closing statements. Each of you will have 90 seconds. <br>Governor Chafee, let's begin with you. <br>CHAFEE: Thank you, Anderson. Thank you, CNN. And thank you, Facebook, for sponsoring this debate. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node1">America has many challenges confronting us — ending the perpetual wars, addressing climate change, addressing income inequality, funding education, funding infrastructure, funding healthcare, helping black Americans, helping Native Americans</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node6">We have many challenges</span>. <span class="highlighted hlcurrent" id="node17">Who is best able to confront these challenges</span>? <br><span class="highlighted" id="node24">I've served in government at many levels</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node29">I know what it's like to solve problems at the local level</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node34">I did it as mayor</span>.

And <span class="highlighted" id="node88">what I'm most proud of is my judgment, particularly in the Iraq war vote</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node93">There was a lot of pressure — political pressure, public pressure</span>. But I <span class="highlighted" id="node98">did my homework</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node103">I did not believe that the evidence was there that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction</span>. And we live now with the consequences. <br>So<span class="highlighted" id="node114"> that kind of judgment is what we want in a president going forward</span>. And<span class="highlighted" id="node119"> I'm running for president to end the wars</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node124">I want to be the peacemaker.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node129">I am a proven peacemaker</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node134">Please go to Chafee 2016 to learn more about me</span>. Thank you. [applause] <br><br>
