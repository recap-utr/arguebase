COOPER : Thank you, Governor.<br><br>O'MALLEY : Thank you.<br><br>COOPER
 :<span class="highlighted" id="node14"> <span class="highlighted" id="node13">Senator Webb, in 2006, you called <span class="highlighted" id="node22">affirmative action 
``state-sponsored racism.''</span></span> </span><span class="highlighted" id="node30">In 2010, you wrote an op/ed saying it 
discriminates against whites.</span> Given that <span class="highlighted" id="node35">nearly half the Democratic 
Party is non-white</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node40">aren't you out of step with where the Democratic 
Party is now?</span><br><br>WEBB : <span class="highlighted" id="node66">No</span>, actually <span class="highlighted" id="node79">I believe that I am where the 
Democratic Party traditionally has been</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node90">The Democratic Party, and the 
reason I've decided to run as a Democrat, has been the party that gives 
people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node100"> 
<span class="highlighted" id="node101">And</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node106">that is not determined by race</span>.</span> And a<span class="highlighted" id="node125">s a clarification, I have 
always supported affirmative action for African Americans</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node130">That's the 
way the program was originally designed because of their unique history 
in this country, with slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed</span>. What<span class="highlighted" id="node135"> I
 have discussed a number of times is the idea that when we create 
diversity programs that include everyone, quote, ``of color,'' other 
than whites, struggling whites like the families in the Appalachian 
mountains, we're not being true to the Democratic Party principle of 
elevating the level of consciousness among our people about the 
hardships that a lot of people who happen to be have - by culture, by 
the way</span>.<br><br>COOPER : <span class="highlighted" id="node154">Senator Webb, thank you very much</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node161">Let's move 
on to some of the most pressing issues facing our country right now, 
some of the biggest issues right now in the headlines today</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node168">We're going
 to start with guns</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node175">The shooting in Oregon earlier this month, once 
again it brought the issue of guns into the national conversation. Over 
the last week, guns have been the most discussed political topic on 
Facebook by two to one.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node182">Senator Sanders, you voted against the Brady 
bill that mandated background checks and a waiting period</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node187">You also 
supported allowing riders to bring guns in checked bags on Amtrak 
trains</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node192">For a decade, you said that holding gun manufacturers legally 
responsible for mass shootings is a bad idea</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node197">Now, you say you're 
reconsidering that</span>. Which is it: <span class="highlighted" id="node202">shield the gun companies from lawsuits 
or not?</span><br><br>SANDERS : Let's begin, Anderson, by understanding that <span class="highlighted" id="node240">
Bernie Sanders has a D-minus voting rating (ph) from the NRA</span>. Let's also
 understand that <span class="highlighted" id="node250">back in 1988 when I first ran for the United States 
Congress, way back then, I told the gun owners of the state of Vermont 
and I told the people of the state of Vermont, a state which has 
virtually no gun control, that I supported a ban on assault weapons</span>. And
 <span class="highlighted" id="node255">over the years, I have strongly avoided instant background checks, 
doing away with this terrible gun show loophole</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node260">I think we've got 
to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man 
purchasers</span>. Also <span class="highlighted" id="node265">I believe, and I've fought for, to understand that 
there are thousands of people in this country today who are suicidal, 
who are homicidal, but can't get the healthcare that they need, the 
mental healthcare, because they don't have insurance or they're too 
poor</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node270">I believe that everybody in this country who has a mental crisis 
has got to get mental health counseling immediately</span>.<br><br>COOPER : <span class="highlighted" id="node308">Do you want to shield gun companies from lawsuits?</span><br><br>SANDERS
 : <span class="highlighted" id="node325">Of course not</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node342">This was a large and complicated bill</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node347">There were 
provisions in it that I think made sense</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node352">For example, do I think that a
 gun shop in the state of Vermont that sells legally a gun to somebody, 
and that somebody goes out and does something crazy, that that gun shop 
owner should be held responsible? I don't</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node357">On the other hand, where you 
have manufacturers and where you have gun shops knowingly giving guns to
 criminals or aiding and abetting that, of course we should take action</span>.<br><br>COOPER : <span class="highlighted" id="node362">Secretary Clinton, is Bernie Sanders tough enough on guns?</span><br><br>CLINTON
 : <span class="highlighted" id="node392">No, not at all</span>. I think that <span class="highlighted" id="node407">we have to look at the fact that we lose
 90 people a day from gun violence</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node412">This has gone on too long and it 's 
time the entire country stood up against the NRA</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node417">The majority of our 
country ... [ applause ] ... supports background checks, and even the 
majority of gun owners do</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node422">Senator Sanders did vote five times against 
the Brady bill</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node427">Since it was passed, more than 2 million prohibited 
purchases have been prevented</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node432"> He also did vote, as he said, for this 
immunity provision</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node437">I voted against it</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node449">I was in the Senate at the same 
time</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node454">It wasn't that complicated to me</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node459">It was pretty straightforward to
 me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in America</span>. 
<span class="highlighted" id="node464">Everybody else has to be accountable, but not the gun manufacturers</span>. And
<span class="highlighted" id="node469"> we need to stand up and say: Enough of that. We 're not going to let it
 continue.</span> [ applause ]<br><br>COOPER : <span class="highlighted" id="node533">We're going to bring you all in on this. But, Senator Sanders, you have to give a response</span>.<br><br>SANDERS
 : <span class="highlighted" id="node540">As a senator from a rural state, what I can tell Secretary Clinton, 
that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what I would hope 
all of us want, and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who 
should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are 
seeing</span>. I believe that <span class="highlighted" id="node545">there is a consensus in this country</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node550">A consensus
 has said we need to strengthen and expand instant background checks, do
 away with this gun show loophole, that we have to address the issue of 
mental health, that we have to deal with the strawman purchasing issue</span>, 
and that<span class="highlighted" id="node555"> when we develop that consensus, we can finally, finally do 
something to address this issue</span>.<br><br>COOPER : <span class="highlighted" id="node594">Governor O'Malley, you 
passed gun legislation as governor of Maryland, but you had a 
Democratic-controlled legislature</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node601">President Obama couldn't convince 
Congress to pass gun legislation after the massacres in Aurora, in 
Newtown, and Charleston</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node608">How can you?</span><br><br>O'MALLEY : And, Anderson, <span class="highlighted" id="node615">I
 also had to overcome a lot of opposition in the leadership of my own 
party to get this done</span>. Look, it's fine to talk about all of these 
things - and I'm glad we're talking about these things - but <span class="highlighted" id="node626">I've 
actually done them</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node631"> We passed comprehensive gun safety legislation, not 
by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node648">We 
actually did it</span>. And, Anderson, <span class="highlighted" id="node676">here tonight in our audience are two 
people that make this issue very, very real</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node681">Sandy and Lonnie Phillips 
are here from Colorado. And their daughter, Jessie, was one of those who
 lost their lives in that awful mass shooting in Aurora</span>. Now, <span class="highlighted" id="node686">to try to 
transform their grief, they went to court, where sometimes progress does
 happen when you file in court, but in this case, you want to talk about
 a - a rigged game, Senator? The game was rigged</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node691"> A man had sold 4,000 
rounds of military ammunition to this - this person that killed their 
daughter, riddled her body with five bullets, and he didn't even ask 
where it was going</span>. And<span class="highlighted" id="node696"> not only did their case get thrown out of court,
 they were slapped with $200,000 in court fees</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node701">because of the way that 
the NRA gets its way in our Congress and we take a backseat</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node706">It's time 
to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation</span>. [
