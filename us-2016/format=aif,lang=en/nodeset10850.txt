HOLT: Your two—your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. <span class="highlighted" id="node1">Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node6">it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men</span>.<br><br><div>TRUMP: <span class="highlighted" id="node17">No</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node26">you're wrong</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node35">It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node46">It was taken away from her</span>.

So <span class="highlighted" id="node363">there's some bad things going on</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node376">Some really bad things</span>.<br><br></div><div>HOLT: Secretary Clinton...<br><br></div><div>TRUMP: But <span class="highlighted" id="node388">we need—Lester, we need law and order</span>.

And, <span class="highlighted" id="node554">in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node559">Property crime is down 40 percent</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node570">We just don't want to see it creep back up</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node578">We've had 25 years of very good cooperation</span>.<br>But <span class="highlighted" id="node597">there were some problems</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node604">some unintended consequences</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node611">Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node626">it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node637">we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node648">We cannot just say law and order</span>. We have to say—<span class="highlighted" id="node662">we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node669">deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little</span>.<br><span class="highlighted" id="node697">We need to have more second chance programs</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node708">I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system</span>; <span class="highlighted" id="node715">I want to see them ended in the state system</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node726">You shouldn't have a profit <span class="highlighted" id="node691">motivation to fill prison cells with </span>young Americans</span>. So t<span class="highlighted" id="node737">here are some positive ways we can work on this</span>.<br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node750">I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node755">Right now—and <span class="highlighted" id="node782">this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby</span>—right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node793">In a lot of places, our police are outgunned</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node806">We need comprehensive background checks</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node817">we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm</span>.<br>And <span class="highlighted" id="node830">we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node837">If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node848">there are things we can do</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node872">we ought to do it in a bipartisan way</span>.<br><br></div>
