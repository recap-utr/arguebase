LOPEZ: Thank you, Anderson. <br>Senator Sanders, <span class="highlighted" id="node1">right here in Nevada, there will be a measure to legalize recreational marijuana on the 2016 ballot</span>. You've said <span class="highlighted" id="node6">you smoked marijuana twice</span>; <span class="highlighted" id="node15">it didn't quite work for you</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node28">If you were a Nevada resident, how would you vote</span>? <br>SANDERS:<span class="highlighted" id="node33"> I suspect I would vote yes</span>. [applause] <br>And I would vote yes because <span class="highlighted" id="node46">I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for non-violent offenses</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node57">We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana</span>. I think <span class="highlighted" id="node62">we have to think through this war on drugs</span>... [applause] ...<span class="highlighted" id="node67">which has done an enormous amount of damage</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node72">We need to rethink our criminal justice system</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node77">we we've got a lot of work to do in that area</span>. <br>O'MALLEY: Juan Carlos? [applause] <br>LOPEZ: Secretary Clinton, you told Christiane Amanpour y<span class="highlighted" id="node129">ou didn't smoke pot when you were young, and you're not going to start now</span>. [laughter] <br>When asked about legalizing recreational marijuana, you told <span class="highlighted" id="node140">her let's wait and see how it plays out in Colorado and Washington</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node149">It's been more than a year since you've said that</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node158">Are you ready to take a position tonight</span>? <br>CLINTON: <span class="highlighted" id="node165">No</span>. I think that <span class="highlighted" id="node176">we have the opportunity through the states that are pursuing recreational marijuana to find out a lot more than we know today</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node181">I do support the use of medical marijuana</span>, and I think <span class="highlighted" id="node186">even there we need to do a lot more research so that we know exactly how we're going to help people for whom medical marijuana provides relief</span>. <br>So, I think <span class="highlighted" id="node191">we're just at the beginning</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node196">I agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana</span>. Therefore, <span class="highlighted" id="node212">we need more states, cities, and the federal government to begin to address this</span> so that <span class="highlighted" id="node223">we don't have this terrible result that Senator Sanders was talking about where we have a huge population in our prisons for nonviolent, low-level offenses that are primarily due to marijuana</span>. <br>COOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. I want to go to Don Lemon with another Facebook question. <br>LEMON: Alright, Anderson. This is for Senator Sanders, OK? This is from Carrie (ph) Kang (ph) from Manassas, Virginia, would like would like to ask the Senator, "<span class="highlighted" id="node234">President Obama has had a difficult time getting Republicans to compromise on just about every agenda</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node239">How will you approach this going forward</span>, and<span class="highlighted" id="node248"> will it be any different</span>?" <br>Senator? <br>SANDERS: <span class="highlighted" id="node255">The Republican party, since I've been in the Senate, and since President Obama has been in office, has played a terrible, terrible role of being total obstructionists</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node266">Every effort that he has made, that some of us have made, they have said no, no, no</span>. <br>Now, in my view, the only way we can take on the <span class="highlighted" id="node277">right wing republicans who are, by the way, I hope will not continue to control the Senate and the House when one of us elected President</span>... [applause] ...But <span class="highlighted" id="node284">the only way we can get things done is by having millions of people coming together</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node295">If we want free tuition at public colleges and universities, millions of young people are going to have to demand it, and give the Republicans an offer they can't refuse</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node306">If we want to raise the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour, workers are going to have to come together and look the Republicans in the eye, and say, "We know what's going on. You vote against us, you are out of your job."</span> [applause] <br>COOPER: We're going to hear from all the candidates coming up. We're going to take a short break. More from the candidates in a moment. [applause] <br>[commercial break]<br><br>
