Because <span class="highlighted" id="node926">I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt , but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms , and it 's just one of those things</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node931">I 'll go one step further</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node936">In Palm Beach , Florida , tough community , a brilliant community , a wealthy community , probably the wealthiest community there is in the world , I opened a club , and really got great credit for it</span> .
