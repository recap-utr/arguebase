  <span class="highlighted" id="node1">I love Donald Trump</span>, you know<span class="highlighted" id="node6"> the establishment GOP hate him</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node11">he has no
  filter</span>. I still think <span class="highlighted" id="node16">he is a secret democrat doing this</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node21">he has the
  influence</span>.<br>
    Mangalz: <span class="highlighted" id="node42">We need more debates with people who just say shit with no filter.</span>
  L<span class="highlighted" id="node49">ike a politically active comedian or something</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node54">Like Joe Rogan or John
  Stewart</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node59">Just to say shit that people have to respond to</span>.<br>
    SonVoltMMA: <span class="highlighted" id="node111">Joe Rogan vs John Stewart: The ultimate alpha vs the ultimate
  wit.</span><br>
    Mangalz: <span class="highlighted" id="node106">No</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node74">I mean like just have them on stage during GOP/DNC debate, or
  put them in charge of asking the questions</span>.<br>
    <span class="highlighted" id="node79">I don't imagine many would be eager to go</span>.<br>
    SweeterThanYoohoo: HOLY SHIT. J<span class="highlighted" id="node138">on Stewart and Jon Oliver as debate
  moderators</span>. I actually think <span class="highlighted" id="node143">Oliver would be better at being a dick</span>, and thus
  <span class="highlighted" id="node148">would be so entertaining</span>. That said, <span class="highlighted" id="node164">I did like that the Fox mods weren't
  lobbing softballs all night</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node169">It was a circus overall</span>, though.<br>
    brent0935: <span class="highlighted" id="node178">That 3d party thing makes this seem even more plausible</span>...<br>
    invader_red: Lol he would be doing more harm to the democrats if he
  was....but ok.<br>
    Sryzon: <span class="highlighted" id="node189">I'm pretty sure he's a Democrat and just trying to prove he can be
  elected president</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node200">The guy is a spineless billionaire</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node205">he'll do absolutely
  anything</span>.<br>
    Now, <span class="highlighted" id="node216">that could either be really good or really bad for the country</span>
  <span class="highlighted" id="node222">depending on if his end goal is financial gain or pride</span>. I'm thinking <span class="highlighted" id="node227">the guy
  has enough money and is bored now</span>, so <span class="highlighted" id="node238">he not only wants to prove he can do
  anything</span>, but that <span class="highlighted" id="node243">he can be a president talked about for centuries</span>.<br>
    Honestly, I don't think <span class="highlighted" id="node280">he'd be a bad president if my assumptions are true</span>.
  <span class="highlighted" id="node285">A guy like that doesn't just flip on abortion, guns and Healthcare</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node290">He knows
  the value of an ally and how to create financial success</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node295">He also has no
  reason to cater to businesses</span>. I think <span class="highlighted" id="node300">he's made his money</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node305">now he wants
  to retire a successful president</span>.<br>
    CarmellaKimara: <span class="highlighted" id="node328">Trump gets the Republican nod</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node333">Hillary gets the Democratic</span>,

  days of real Republicans</span>."<br>
    Charles1202: I <span class="highlighted" id="node356">was originally thinking Bernie picking Rand as his VP to
  sway libertarians and grassroot conservatives</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node361">Trump picking up Bernie to
  go against Hillary could be an unholy alliance</span><br>
    CarmellaKimara: <span class="highlighted" id="node370">If Bernie picks rand, I may end up voting for Trump</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node375">That
  would be a Sarah Palin level of a pick</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node380">Trump hasn't touched abortion from
  what I've seen, whereas that's one of Rand's major talking points</span>.<br>
    <span class="highlighted" id="node399">Libertarians and Social Democrats do work together</span> (<span class="highlighted" id="node404">I'm pretty libertarian</span>;<span class="highlighted" id="node426">
  the government's job should only exist to serve its people [actual
  non-parasitic humans]</span> -<span class="highlighted" id="node431">if something doesn't do that, it should be axed</span>) but
  <span class="highlighted" id="node409">not the faux libertarians like Rand</span>.<br>
    Charles1202: <span class="highlighted" id="node448">Yea I wasn't completely serious in my post, it was more a joke
  me and my buddy keep throwing around</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node453">Rand is the closest we have to a
  libertarian since Ron Paul or Gary Johnson</span><br>

    jackarooh:<span class="highlighted" id="node496">Carly Fiorina mentioned during the "lower seven" debate
  (or whatever you want to call it)</span>, that Trump got a call from Bill Clinton
  wishing him luck for his debate.
